              "' 10\\n\\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic\\nFaction and Insurrection)\\n\\nFrom the Daily Advertiser. Thursday, November 22, 1787.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nAMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed Union, none\\ndeserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and\\ncontrol the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never\\nfinds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he\\ncontemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail,\\ntherefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the\\nprinciples to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it.\\nThe instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public\\ncouncils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular\\ngovernments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the\\nfavorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty\\nderive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made\\nby the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient\\nand modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an\\nunwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually\\nobviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints\\nare everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens,\\nequally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and\\npersonal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public\\ngood is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures\\nare too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the\\nrights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested\\nand overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these\\ncomplaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not\\npermit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found,\\nindeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses\\nunder which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation\\nof our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other\\ncauses will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes;\\nand, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public\\nengagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one\\nend of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly,\\neffects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit\\nhas tainted our public administrations.\\n\\nBy a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a\\nmajority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some\\ncommon impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of\\nother citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the\\ncommunity.\\n\\nThere are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by\\nremoving its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.\\n\\nThere are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the\\none, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the\\nother, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions,\\nand the same interests.\\n\\nIt could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was\\nworse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an\\naliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less\\nfolly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because\\nit nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of\\nair, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its\\ndestructive agency.\\n\\nThe second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise.\\nAs long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty\\nto exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the\\nconnection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions\\nand his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the\\nformer will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The\\ndiversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property\\noriginate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of\\ninterests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of\\ngovernment. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of\\nacquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of\\nproperty immediately results; and from the influence of these on the\\nsentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of\\nthe society into different interests and parties.\\n\\nThe latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and\\nwe see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity,\\naccording to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for\\ndifferent opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many\\nother points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to\\ndifferent leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or\\nto persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting\\nto the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties,\\ninflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more\\ndisposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their\\ncommon good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual\\nanimosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the\\nmost frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle\\ntheir unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But\\nthe most common and durable source of factions has been the various\\nand unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are\\nwithout property have ever formed distinct interests in society.\\nThose who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a\\nlike discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a\\nmercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,\\ngrow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into\\ndifferent classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The\\nregulation of these various and interfering interests forms the\\nprincipal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party\\nand faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.\\n\\nNo man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest\\nwould certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his\\nintegrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit\\nto be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the\\nmost important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations,\\nnot indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the\\nrights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes\\nof legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they\\ndetermine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question\\nto which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the\\nother. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties\\nare, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party,\\nor, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to\\nprevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree,\\nby restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be\\ndifferently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and\\nprobably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good.\\nThe apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is\\nan act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is,\\nperhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation\\nare given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice.\\nEvery shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a\\nshilling saved to their own pockets.\\n\\nIt is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust\\nthese clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public\\ngood. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many\\ncases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view\\nindirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the\\nimmediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights\\nof another or the good of the whole.\\n\\nThe inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction\\ncannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of\\ncontrolling its EFFECTS.\\n\\nIf a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the\\nrepublican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister\\nviews by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse\\nthe society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence\\nunder the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a\\nfaction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it\\nto sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good\\nand the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private\\nrights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to\\npreserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the\\ngreat object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is\\nthe great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued\\nfrom the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be\\nrecommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.\\n\\nBy what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only.\\nEither the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at\\nthe same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent\\npassion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local\\nsituation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of\\noppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide,\\nwe well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on\\nas an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice\\nand violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to\\nthe number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy\\nbecomes needful.\\n\\nFrom this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy,\\nby which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who\\nassemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure\\nfor the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in\\nalmost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication\\nand concert result from the form of government itself; and there is\\nnothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an\\nobnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever\\nbeen spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found\\nincompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have\\nin general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in\\ntheir deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species\\nof government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to\\na perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same\\ntime, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their\\nopinions, and their passions.\\n\\nA republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of\\nrepresentation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises\\nthe cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it\\nvaries from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of\\nthe cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.\\n\\nThe two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic\\nare: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small\\nnumber of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of\\ncitizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be\\nextended.\\n\\nThe effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and\\nenlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen\\nbody of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of\\ntheir country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least\\nlikely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under\\nsuch a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced\\nby the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the\\npublic good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for\\nthe purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of\\nfactious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by\\nintrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages,\\nand then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is,\\nwhether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election\\nof proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in\\nfavor of the latter by two obvious considerations:\\n\\nIn the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the\\nrepublic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number,\\nin order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large\\nit may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to\\nguard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of\\nrepresentatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of\\nthe two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small\\nrepublic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not\\nless in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a\\ngreater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.\\n\\nIn the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater\\nnumber of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will\\nbe more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the\\nvicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages\\nof the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who\\npossess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established\\ncharacters.\\n\\nIt must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a\\nmean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie.\\nBy enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the\\nrepresentatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances\\nand lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly\\nattached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and\\nnational objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in\\nthis respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the\\nnational, the local and particular to the State legislatures.\\n\\nThe other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens\\nand extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of\\nrepublican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance\\nprincipally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded\\nin the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer\\nprobably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the\\nfewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will\\na majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of\\nindividuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within\\nwhich they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute\\ntheir plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater\\nvariety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a\\nmajority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights\\nof other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more\\ndifficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act\\nin unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked\\nthat, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes,\\ncommunication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number\\nwhose concurrence is necessary.\\n\\nHence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has\\nover a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by\\na large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the\\nStates composing it. Does the advantage consist in the substitution of\\nrepresentatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render\\nthem superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not\\nbe denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely\\nto possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater\\nsecurity afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of\\nany one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal\\ndegree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the\\nUnion, increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater\\nobstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes\\nof an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the\\nUnion gives it the most palpable advantage.\\n\\nThe influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their\\nparticular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration\\nthrough the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a\\npolitical faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects\\ndispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils\\nagainst any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an\\nabolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other\\nimproper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body\\nof the Union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as\\nsuch a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district,\\nthan an entire State.\\n\\nIn the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold\\na republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican\\ngovernment. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel\\nin being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and\\nsupporting the character of Federalists.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 14\\n\\nObjections to the Proposed Constitution From Extent of Territory\\nAnswered\\n\\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, November 30, 1787.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nWE HAVE seen the necessity of the Union, as our bulwark against foreign\\ndanger, as the conservator of peace among ourselves, as the guardian\\nof our commerce and other common interests, as the only substitute for\\nthose military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the\\nOld World, and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction, which\\nhave proved fatal to other popular governments, and of which alarming\\nsymptoms have been betrayed by our own. All that remains, within this\\nbranch of our inquiries, is to take notice of an objection that may be\\ndrawn from the great extent of country which the Union embraces. A few\\nobservations on this subject will be the more proper, as it is perceived\\nthat the adversaries of the new Constitution are availing themselves\\nof the prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere\\nof republican administration, in order to supply, by imaginary\\ndifficulties, the want of those solid objections which they endeavor in\\nvain to find.\\n\\nThe error which limits republican government to a narrow district has\\nbeen unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only that\\nit seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a\\nrepublic with a democracy, applying to the former reasonings drawn from\\nthe nature of the latter. The true distinction between these forms was\\nalso adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the\\npeople meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic,\\nthey assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A\\ndemocracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic\\nmay be extended over a large region.\\n\\nTo this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of some\\ncelebrated authors, whose writings have had a great share in forming\\nthe modern standard of political opinions. Being subjects either of\\nan absolute or limited monarchy, they have endeavored to heighten\\nthe advantages, or palliate the evils of those forms, by placing in\\ncomparison the vices and defects of the republican, and by citing as\\nspecimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient Greece and\\nmodern Italy. Under the confusion of names, it has been an easy task to\\ntransfer to a republic observations applicable to a democracy only; and\\namong others, the observation that it can never be established but among\\na small number of people, living within a small compass of territory.\\n\\nSuch a fallacy may have been the less perceived, as most of the popular\\ngovernments of antiquity were of the democratic species; and even in\\nmodern Europe, to which we owe the great principle of representation, no\\nexample is seen of a government wholly popular, and founded, at the same\\ntime, wholly on that principle. If Europe has the merit of discovering\\nthis great mechanical power in government, by the simple agency of which\\nthe will of the largest political body may be concentred, and its force\\ndirected to any object which the public good requires, America can claim\\nthe merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive\\nrepublics. It is only to be lamented that any of her citizens should\\nwish to deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full\\nefficacy in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her\\nconsideration.\\n\\nAs the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central\\npoint which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as\\noften as their public functions demand, and will include no greater\\nnumber than can join in those functions; so the natural limit of a\\nrepublic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow\\nthe representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the\\nadministration of public affairs. Can it be said that the limits of the\\nUnited States exceed this distance? It will not be said by those who\\nrecollect that the Atlantic coast is the longest side of the Union, that\\nduring the term of thirteen years, the representatives of the States\\nhave been almost continually assembled, and that the members from the\\nmost distant States are not chargeable with greater intermissions of\\nattendance than those from the States in the neighborhood of Congress.\\n\\nThat we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting\\nsubject, let us resort to the actual dimensions of the Union. The\\nlimits, as fixed by the treaty of peace, are: on the east the Atlantic,\\non the south the latitude of thirty-one degrees, on the west the\\nMississippi, and on the north an irregular line running in some\\ninstances beyond the forty-fifth degree, in others falling as low as the\\nforty-second. The southern shore of Lake Erie lies below that latitude.\\nComputing the distance between the thirty-first and forty-fifth degrees,\\nit amounts to nine hundred and seventy-three common miles; computing it\\nfrom thirty-one to forty-two degrees, to seven hundred and sixty-four\\nmiles and a half. Taking the mean for the distance, the amount will be\\neight hundred and sixty-eight miles and three-fourths. The mean distance\\nfrom the Atlantic to the Mississippi does not probably exceed seven\\nhundred and fifty miles. On a comparison of this extent with that of\\nseveral countries in Europe, the practicability of rendering our system\\ncommensurate to it appears to be demonstrable. It is not a great deal\\nlarger than Germany, where a diet representing the whole empire is\\ncontinually assembled; or than Poland before the late dismemberment,\\nwhere another national diet was the depositary of the supreme power.\\nPassing by France and Spain, we find that in Great Britain, inferior as\\nit may be in size, the representatives of the northern extremity of the\\nisland have as far to travel to the national council as will be required\\nof those of the most remote parts of the Union.\\n\\nFavorable as this view of the subject may be, some observations remain\\nwhich will place it in a light still more satisfactory.\\n\\nIn the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is\\nnot to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws.\\nIts jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern\\nall the members of the republic, but which are not to be attained by\\nthe separate provisions of any. The subordinate governments, which can\\nextend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately\\nprovided for, will retain their due authority and activity. Were it\\nproposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of\\nthe particular States, its adversaries would have some ground for their\\nobjection; though it would not be difficult to show that if they were\\nabolished the general government would be compelled, by the principle of\\nself-preservation, to reinstate them in their proper jurisdiction.\\n\\nA second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the\\nfederal Constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive\\nStates, which we know to be practicable; and to add to them such other\\nStates as may arise in their own bosoms, or in their neighborhoods,\\nwhich we cannot doubt to be equally practicable. The arrangements that\\nmay be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which\\nlie on our northwestern frontier, must be left to those whom further\\ndiscoveries and experience will render more equal to the task.\\n\\nLet it be remarked, in the third place, that the intercourse throughout\\nthe Union will be facilitated by new improvements. Roads will everywhere\\nbe shortened, and kept in better order; accommodations for travelers\\nwill be multiplied and meliorated; an interior navigation on our eastern\\nside will be opened throughout, or nearly throughout, the whole extent\\nof the thirteen States. The communication between the Western and\\nAtlantic districts, and between different parts of each, will be\\nrendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the\\nbeneficence of nature has intersected our country, and which art finds\\nit so little difficult to connect and complete.\\n\\nA fourth and still more important consideration is, that as almost every\\nState will, on one side or other, be a frontier, and will thus find, in\\nregard to its safety, an inducement to make some sacrifices for the\\nsake of the general protection; so the States which lie at the greatest\\ndistance from the heart of the Union, and which, of course, may partake\\nleast of the ordinary circulation of its benefits, will be at the same\\ntime immediately contiguous to foreign nations, and will consequently\\nstand, on particular occasions, in greatest need of its strength and\\nresources. It may be inconvenient for Georgia, or the States forming our\\nwestern or northeastern borders, to send their representatives to the\\nseat of government; but they would find it more so to struggle alone\\nagainst an invading enemy, or even to support alone the whole expense of\\nthose precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual\\ndanger. If they should derive less benefit, therefore, from the Union\\nin some respects than the less distant States, they will derive greater\\nbenefit from it in other respects, and thus the proper equilibrium will\\nbe maintained throughout.\\n\\nI submit to you, my fellow-citizens, these considerations, in full\\nconfidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions\\nwill allow them their due weight and effect; and that you will never\\nsuffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance, or however\\nfashionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive you into\\nthe gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion\\nwould conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you\\nthat the people of America, knit together as they are by so many cords\\nof affection, can no longer live together as members of the same family;\\ncan no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness;\\ncan no longer be fellow citizens of one great, respectable, and\\nflourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you\\nthat the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty\\nin the political world; that it has never yet had a place in the\\ntheories of the wildest projectors; that it rashly attempts what it is\\nimpossible to accomplish. No, my countrymen, shut your ears against\\nthis unhallowed language. Shut your hearts against the poison which\\nit conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American\\ncitizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their\\nsacred rights, consecrate their Union, and excite horror at the idea\\nof their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be\\nshunned, believe me, the most alarming of all novelties, the most wild\\nof all projects, the most rash of all attempts, is that of rendering us\\nin pieces, in order to preserve our liberties and promote our happiness.\\nBut why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected, merely\\nbecause it may comprise what is new? Is it not the glory of the people\\nof America, that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions\\nof former times and other nations, they have not suffered a blind\\nveneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule\\nthe suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own\\nsituation, and the lessons of their own experience? To this manly\\nspirit, posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the world\\nfor the example, of the numerous innovations displayed on the American\\ntheatre, in favor of private rights and public happiness. Had no\\nimportant step been taken by the leaders of the Revolution for which a\\nprecedent could not be discovered, no government established of which\\nan exact model did not present itself, the people of the United States\\nmight, at this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of\\nmisguided councils, must at best have been laboring under the weight\\nof some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of\\nmankind. Happily for America, happily, we trust, for the whole human\\nrace, they pursued a new and more noble course. They accomplished a\\nrevolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society. They\\nreared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of\\nthe globe. They formed the design of a great Confederacy, which it is\\nincumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate. If their works\\nbetray imperfections, we wonder at the fewness of them. If they erred\\nmost in the structure of the Union, this was the work most difficult to\\nbe executed; this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of\\nyour convention, and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate\\nand to decide.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 37\\n\\nConcerning the Difficulties of the Convention in Devising a Proper Form\\nof Government.\\n\\nFrom the Daily Advertiser. Friday, January 11, 1788.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nIN REVIEWING the defects of the existing Confederation, and showing that\\nthey cannot be supplied by a government of less energy than that before\\nthe public, several of the most important principles of the latter\\nfell of course under consideration. But as the ultimate object of\\nthese papers is to determine clearly and fully the merits of this\\nConstitution, and the expediency of adopting it, our plan cannot be\\ncomplete without taking a more critical and thorough survey of the work\\nof the convention, without examining it on all its sides, comparing\\nit in all its parts, and calculating its probable effects. That this\\nremaining task may be executed under impressions conducive to a just\\nand fair result, some reflections must in this place be indulged, which\\ncandor previously suggests.\\n\\nIt is a misfortune, inseparable from human affairs, that public\\nmeasures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation which\\nis essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to advance\\nor obstruct the public good; and that this spirit is more apt to be\\ndiminished than promoted, by those occasions which require an unusual\\nexercise of it. To those who have been led by experience to attend to\\nthis consideration, it could not appear surprising, that the act of the\\nconvention, which recommends so many important changes and innovations,\\nwhich may be viewed in so many lights and relations, and which touches\\nthe springs of so many passions and interests, should find or excite\\ndispositions unfriendly, both on one side and on the other, to a fair\\ndiscussion and accurate judgment of its merits. In some, it has been too\\nevident from their own publications, that they have scanned the proposed\\nConstitution, not only with a predisposition to censure, but with a\\npredetermination to condemn; as the language held by others betrays an\\nopposite predetermination or bias, which must render their opinions also\\nof little moment in the question. In placing, however, these different\\ncharacters on a level, with respect to the weight of their opinions, I\\nwish not to insinuate that there may not be a material difference in\\nthe purity of their intentions. It is but just to remark in favor of the\\nlatter description, that as our situation is universally admitted to be\\npeculiarly critical, and to require indispensably that something should\\nbe done for our relief, the predetermined patron of what has been\\nactually done may have taken his bias from the weight of these\\nconsiderations, as well as from considerations of a sinister nature. The\\npredetermined adversary, on the other hand, can have been governed by no\\nvenial motive whatever. The intentions of the first may be upright, as\\nthey may on the contrary be culpable. The views of the last cannot be\\nupright, and must be culpable. But the truth is, that these papers are\\nnot addressed to persons falling under either of these characters. They\\nsolicit the attention of those only, who add to a sincere zeal for the\\nhappiness of their country, a temper favorable to a just estimate of the\\nmeans of promoting it.\\n\\nPersons of this character will proceed to an examination of the plan\\nsubmitted by the convention, not only without a disposition to find\\nor to magnify faults; but will see the propriety of reflecting, that\\na faultless plan was not to be expected. Nor will they barely make\\nallowances for the errors which may be chargeable on the fallibility to\\nwhich the convention, as a body of men, were liable; but will keep in\\nmind, that they themselves also are but men, and ought not to assume an\\ninfallibility in rejudging the fallible opinions of others.\\n\\nWith equal readiness will it be perceived, that besides these\\ninducements to candor, many allowances ought to be made for the\\ndifficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred to\\nthe convention.\\n\\nThe novelty of the undertaking immediately strikes us. It has been\\nshown in the course of these papers, that the existing Confederation is\\nfounded on principles which are fallacious; that we must consequently\\nchange this first foundation, and with it the superstructure resting\\nupon it. It has been shown, that the other confederacies which could\\nbe consulted as precedents have been vitiated by the same erroneous\\nprinciples, and can therefore furnish no other light than that of\\nbeacons, which give warning of the course to be shunned, without\\npointing out that which ought to be pursued. The most that the\\nconvention could do in such a situation, was to avoid the errors\\nsuggested by the past experience of other countries, as well as of our\\nown; and to provide a convenient mode of rectifying their own errors, as\\nfuture experiences may unfold them.\\n\\nAmong the difficulties encountered by the convention, a very important\\none must have lain in combining the requisite stability and energy in\\ngovernment, with the inviolable attention due to liberty and to the\\nrepublican form. Without substantially accomplishing this part of their\\nundertaking, they would have very imperfectly fulfilled the object of\\ntheir appointment, or the expectation of the public; yet that it could\\nnot be easily accomplished, will be denied by no one who is unwilling to\\nbetray his ignorance of the subject. Energy in government is essential\\nto that security against external and internal danger, and to that\\nprompt and salutary execution of the laws which enter into the very\\ndefinition of good government. Stability in government is essential to\\nnational character and to the advantages annexed to it, as well as to\\nthat repose and confidence in the minds of the people, which are\\namong the chief blessings of civil society. An irregular and mutable\\nlegislation is not more an evil in itself than it is odious to the\\npeople; and it may be pronounced with assurance that the people of\\nthis country, enlightened as they are with regard to the nature, and\\ninterested, as the great body of them are, in the effects of good\\ngovernment, will never be satisfied till some remedy be applied to\\nthe vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize the State\\nadministrations. On comparing, however, these valuable ingredients with\\nthe vital principles of liberty, we must perceive at once the difficulty\\nof mingling them together in their due proportions. The genius of\\nrepublican liberty seems to demand on one side, not only that all power\\nshould be derived from the people, but that those intrusted with it\\nshould be kept in independence on the people, by a short duration of\\ntheir appointments; and that even during this short period the trust\\nshould be placed not in a few, but a number of hands. Stability, on\\nthe contrary, requires that the hands in which power is lodged should\\ncontinue for a length of time the same. A frequent change of men will\\nresult from a frequent return of elections; and a frequent change of\\nmeasures from a frequent change of men: whilst energy in government\\nrequires not only a certain duration of power, but the execution of it\\nby a single hand.\\n\\nHow far the convention may have succeeded in this part of their work,\\nwill better appear on a more accurate view of it. From the cursory view\\nhere taken, it must clearly appear to have been an arduous part.\\n\\nNot less arduous must have been the task of marking the proper line of\\npartition between the authority of the general and that of the\\nState governments. Every man will be sensible of this difficulty, in\\nproportion as he has been accustomed to contemplate and discriminate\\nobjects extensive and complicated in their nature. The faculties of\\nthe mind itself have never yet been distinguished and defined, with\\nsatisfactory precision, by all the efforts of the most acute and\\nmetaphysical philosophers. Sense, perception, judgment, desire,\\nvolition, memory, imagination, are found to be separated by such\\ndelicate shades and minute gradations that their boundaries have\\neluded the most subtle investigations, and remain a pregnant source of\\ningenious disquisition and controversy. The boundaries between the great\\nkingdom of nature, and, still more, between the various provinces,\\nand lesser portions, into which they are subdivided, afford another\\nillustration of the same important truth. The most sagacious and\\nlaborious naturalists have never yet succeeded in tracing with certainty\\nthe line which separates the district of vegetable life from the\\nneighboring region of unorganized matter, or which marks the termination\\nof the former and the commencement of the animal empire. A still greater\\nobscurity lies in the distinctive characters by which the objects\\nin each of these great departments of nature have been arranged and\\nassorted.\\n\\nWhen we pass from the works of nature, in which all the delineations\\nare perfectly accurate, and appear to be otherwise only from the\\nimperfection of the eye which surveys them, to the institutions of man,\\nin which the obscurity arises as well from the object itself as from\\nthe organ by which it is contemplated, we must perceive the necessity of\\nmoderating still further our expectations and hopes from the efforts\\nof human sagacity. Experience has instructed us that no skill in the\\nscience of government has yet been able to discriminate and define,\\nwith sufficient certainty, its three great provinces the legislative,\\nexecutive, and judiciary; or even the privileges and powers of the\\ndifferent legislative branches. Questions daily occur in the course of\\npractice, which prove the obscurity which reins in these subjects, and\\nwhich puzzle the greatest adepts in political science.\\n\\nThe experience of ages, with the continued and combined labors of the\\nmost enlightened legislatures and jurists, has been equally unsuccessful\\nin delineating the several objects and limits of different codes of laws\\nand different tribunals of justice. The precise extent of the common\\nlaw, and the statute law, the maritime law, the ecclesiastical law, the\\nlaw of corporations, and other local laws and customs, remains still to\\nbe clearly and finally established in Great Britain, where accuracy in\\nsuch subjects has been more industriously pursued than in any other part\\nof the world. The jurisdiction of her several courts, general and local,\\nof law, of equity, of admiralty, etc., is not less a source of frequent\\nand intricate discussions, sufficiently denoting the indeterminate\\nlimits by which they are respectively circumscribed. All new laws,\\nthough penned with the greatest technical skill, and passed on the\\nfullest and most mature deliberation, are considered as more or less\\nobscure and equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and ascertained\\nby a series of particular discussions and adjudications. Besides the\\nobscurity arising from the complexity of objects, and the imperfection\\nof the human faculties, the medium through which the conceptions of men\\nare conveyed to each other adds a fresh embarrassment. The use of words\\nis to express ideas. Perspicuity, therefore, requires not only that the\\nideas should be distinctly formed, but that they should be expressed by\\nwords distinctly and exclusively appropriate to them. But no language is\\nso copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea, or\\nso correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different\\nideas. Hence it must happen that however accurately objects may be\\ndiscriminated in themselves, and however accurately the discrimination\\nmay be considered, the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate\\nby the inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered. And this\\nunavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less, according to the\\ncomplexity and novelty of the objects defined. When the Almighty himself\\ncondescends to address mankind in their own language, his meaning,\\nluminous as it must be, is rendered dim and doubtful by the cloudy\\nmedium through which it is communicated.\\n\\nHere, then, are three sources of vague and incorrect definitions:\\nindistinctness of the object, imperfection of the organ of conception,\\ninadequateness of the vehicle of ideas. Any one of these must produce a\\ncertain degree of obscurity. The convention, in delineating the boundary\\nbetween the federal and State jurisdictions, must have experienced the\\nfull effect of them all.\\n\\nTo the difficulties already mentioned may be added the interfering\\npretensions of the larger and smaller States. We cannot err in supposing\\nthat the former would contend for a participation in the government,\\nfully proportioned to their superior wealth and importance; and that the\\nlatter would not be less tenacious of the equality at present enjoyed by\\nthem. We may well suppose that neither side would entirely yield to the\\nother, and consequently that the struggle could be terminated only by\\ncompromise. It is extremely probable, also, that after the ratio\\nof representation had been adjusted, this very compromise must have\\nproduced a fresh struggle between the same parties, to give such a turn\\nto the organization of the government, and to the distribution of its\\npowers, as would increase the importance of the branches, in forming\\nwhich they had respectively obtained the greatest share of influence.\\nThere are features in the Constitution which warrant each of these\\nsuppositions; and as far as either of them is well founded, it shows\\nthat the convention must have been compelled to sacrifice theoretical\\npropriety to the force of extraneous considerations.\\n\\nNor could it have been the large and small States only, which would\\nmarshal themselves in opposition to each other on various points. Other\\ncombinations, resulting from a difference of local position and policy,\\nmust have created additional difficulties. As every State may be divided\\ninto different districts, and its citizens into different classes,\\nwhich give birth to contending interests and local jealousies, so the\\ndifferent parts of the United States are distinguished from each other\\nby a variety of circumstances, which produce a like effect on a larger\\nscale. And although this variety of interests, for reasons sufficiently\\nexplained in a former paper, may have a salutary influence on the\\nadministration of the government when formed, yet every one must be\\nsensible of the contrary influence, which must have been experienced in\\nthe task of forming it.\\n\\nWould it be wonderful if, under the pressure of all these difficulties,\\nthe convention should have been forced into some deviations from that\\nartificial structure and regular symmetry which an abstract view of the\\nsubject might lead an ingenious theorist to bestow on a Constitution\\nplanned in his closet or in his imagination? The real wonder is that\\nso many difficulties should have been surmounted, and surmounted with a\\nunanimity almost as unprecedented as it must have been unexpected. It is\\nimpossible for any man of candor to reflect on this circumstance without\\npartaking of the astonishment. It is impossible for the man of pious\\nreflection not to perceive in it a finger of that Almighty hand which\\nhas been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the\\ncritical stages of the revolution.\\n\\nWe had occasion, in a former paper, to take notice of the repeated\\ntrials which have been unsuccessfully made in the United Netherlands\\nfor reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their constitution. The\\nhistory of almost all the great councils and consultations held among\\nmankind for reconciling their discordant opinions, assuaging their\\nmutual jealousies, and adjusting their respective interests, is a\\nhistory of factions, contentions, and disappointments, and may be\\nclassed among the most dark and degraded pictures which display the\\ninfirmities and depravities of the human character. If, in a few\\nscattered instances, a brighter aspect is presented, they serve only as\\nexceptions to admonish us of the general truth; and by their lustre to\\ndarken the gloom of the adverse prospect to which they are contrasted.\\nIn revolving the causes from which these exceptions result, and applying\\nthem to the particular instances before us, we are necessarily led to\\ntwo important conclusions. The first is, that the convention must have\\nenjoyed, in a very singular degree, an exemption from the pestilential\\ninfluence of party animosities the disease most incident to deliberative\\nbodies, and most apt to contaminate their proceedings. The second\\nconclusion is that all the deputations composing the convention were\\nsatisfactorily accommodated by the final act, or were induced to accede\\nto it by a deep conviction of the necessity of sacrificing private\\nopinions and partial interests to the public good, and by a despair of\\nseeing this necessity diminished by delays or by new experiments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 38\\n\\nThe Same Subject Continued, and the Incoherence of the Objections to the\\nNew Plan Exposed.\\n\\nFrom The Independent Journal. Saturday, January 12, 1788.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nIT IS not a little remarkable that in every case reported by ancient\\nhistory, in which government has been established with deliberation and\\nconsent, the task of framing it has not been committed to an assembly\\nof men, but has been performed by some individual citizen of preeminent\\nwisdom and approved integrity.\\n\\nMinos, we learn, was the primitive founder of the government of Crete,\\nas Zaleucus was of that of the Locrians. Theseus first, and after him\\nDraco and Solon, instituted the government of Athens. Lycurgus was the\\nlawgiver of Sparta. The foundation of the original government of Rome\\nwas laid by Romulus, and the work completed by two of his elective\\nsuccessors, Numa and Tullius Hostilius. On the abolition of royalty the\\nconsular administration was substituted by Brutus, who stepped forward\\nwith a project for such a reform, which, he alleged, had been prepared\\nby Tullius Hostilius, and to which his address obtained the assent and\\nratification of the senate and people. This remark is applicable to\\nconfederate governments also. Amphictyon, we are told, was the author\\nof that which bore his name. The Achaean league received its first birth\\nfrom Achaeus, and its second from Aratus.\\n\\nWhat degree of agency these reputed lawgivers might have in their\\nrespective establishments, or how far they might be clothed with\\nthe legitimate authority of the people, cannot in every instance be\\nascertained. In some, however, the proceeding was strictly regular.\\nDraco appears to have been intrusted by the people of Athens with\\nindefinite powers to reform its government and laws. And Solon,\\naccording to Plutarch, was in a manner compelled, by the universal\\nsuffrage of his fellow-citizens, to take upon him the sole and absolute\\npower of new-modeling the constitution. The proceedings under Lycurgus\\nwere less regular; but as far as the advocates for a regular reform\\ncould prevail, they all turned their eyes towards the single efforts of\\nthat celebrated patriot and sage, instead of seeking to bring about a\\nrevolution by the intervention of a deliberative body of citizens.\\n\\nWhence could it have proceeded, that a people, jealous as the Greeks\\nwere of their liberty, should so far abandon the rules of caution as to\\nplace their destiny in the hands of a single citizen? Whence could it\\nhave proceeded, that the Athenians, a people who would not suffer an\\narmy to be commanded by fewer than ten generals, and who required no\\nother proof of danger to their liberties than the illustrious merit of\\na fellow-citizen, should consider one illustrious citizen as a more\\neligible depositary of the fortunes of themselves and their posterity,\\nthan a select body of citizens, from whose common deliberations\\nmore wisdom, as well as more safety, might have been expected? These\\nquestions cannot be fully answered, without supposing that the fears\\nof discord and disunion among a number of counsellors exceeded the\\napprehension of treachery or incapacity in a single individual. History\\ninforms us, likewise, of the difficulties with which these celebrated\\nreformers had to contend, as well as the expedients which they were\\nobliged to employ in order to carry their reforms into effect. Solon,\\nwho seems to have indulged a more temporizing policy, confessed that\\nhe had not given to his countrymen the government best suited to their\\nhappiness, but most tolerable to their prejudices. And Lycurgus, more\\ntrue to his object, was under the necessity of mixing a portion of\\nviolence with the authority of superstition, and of securing his final\\nsuccess by a voluntary renunciation, first of his country, and then\\nof his life. If these lessons teach us, on one hand, to admire the\\nimprovement made by America on the ancient mode of preparing and\\nestablishing regular plans of government, they serve not less, on the\\nother, to admonish us of the hazards and difficulties incident to such\\nexperiments, and of the great imprudence of unnecessarily multiplying\\nthem.\\n\\nIs it an unreasonable conjecture, that the errors which may be contained\\nin the plan of the convention are such as have resulted rather from\\nthe defect of antecedent experience on this complicated and difficult\\nsubject, than from a want of accuracy or care in the investigation of\\nit; and, consequently such as will not be ascertained until an actual\\ntrial shall have pointed them out? This conjecture is rendered probable,\\nnot only by many considerations of a general nature, but by the\\nparticular case of the Articles of Confederation. It is observable that\\namong the numerous objections and amendments suggested by the several\\nStates, when these articles were submitted for their ratification,\\nnot one is found which alludes to the great and radical error which on\\nactual trial has discovered itself. And if we except the observations\\nwhich New Jersey was led to make, rather by her local situation, than by\\nher peculiar foresight, it may be questioned whether a single suggestion\\nwas of sufficient moment to justify a revision of the system. There\\nis abundant reason, nevertheless, to suppose that immaterial as these\\nobjections were, they would have been adhered to with a very dangerous\\ninflexibility, in some States, had not a zeal for their opinions and\\nsupposed interests been stifled by the more powerful sentiment of\\nself-preservation. One State, we may remember, persisted for several\\nyears in refusing her concurrence, although the enemy remained the whole\\nperiod at our gates, or rather in the very bowels of our country. Nor\\nwas her pliancy in the end effected by a less motive, than the fear of\\nbeing chargeable with protracting the public calamities, and endangering\\nthe event of the contest. Every candid reader will make the proper\\nreflections on these important facts.\\n\\nA patient who finds his disorder daily growing worse, and that an\\nefficacious remedy can no longer be delayed without extreme danger,\\nafter coolly revolving his situation, and the characters of different\\nphysicians, selects and calls in such of them as he judges most capable\\nof administering relief, and best entitled to his confidence. The\\nphysicians attend; the case of the patient is carefully examined; a\\nconsultation is held; they are unanimously agreed that the symptoms are\\ncritical, but that the case, with proper and timely relief, is so far\\nfrom being desperate, that it may be made to issue in an improvement of\\nhis constitution. They are equally unanimous in prescribing the remedy,\\nby which this happy effect is to be produced. The prescription is no\\nsooner made known, however, than a number of persons interpose, and,\\nwithout denying the reality or danger of the disorder, assure the\\npatient that the prescription will be poison to his constitution, and\\nforbid him, under pain of certain death, to make use of it. Might not\\nthe patient reasonably demand, before he ventured to follow this advice,\\nthat the authors of it should at least agree among themselves on some\\nother remedy to be substituted? And if he found them differing as\\nmuch from one another as from his first counsellors, would he not\\nact prudently in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by the\\nlatter, rather than be hearkening to those who could neither deny the\\nnecessity of a speedy remedy, nor agree in proposing one?\\n\\nSuch a patient and in such a situation is America at this moment.\\nShe has been sensible of her malady. She has obtained a regular and\\nunanimous advice from men of her own deliberate choice. And she is\\nwarned by others against following this advice under pain of the most\\nfatal consequences. Do the monitors deny the reality of her danger? No.\\nDo they deny the necessity of some speedy and powerful remedy? No. Are\\nthey agreed, are any two of them agreed, in their objections to the\\nremedy proposed, or in the proper one to be substituted? Let them speak\\nfor themselves. This one tells us that the proposed Constitution ought\\nto be rejected, because it is not a confederation of the States, but\\na government over individuals. Another admits that it ought to be a\\ngovernment over individuals to a certain extent, but by no means to\\nthe extent proposed. A third does not object to the government over\\nindividuals, or to the extent proposed, but to the want of a bill of\\nrights. A fourth concurs in the absolute necessity of a bill of rights,\\nbut contends that it ought to be declaratory, not of the personal\\nrights of individuals, but of the rights reserved to the States in their\\npolitical capacity. A fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights of any\\nsort would be superfluous and misplaced, and that the plan would be\\nunexceptionable but for the fatal power of regulating the times and\\nplaces of election. An objector in a large State exclaims loudly against\\nthe unreasonable equality of representation in the Senate. An objector\\nin a small State is equally loud against the dangerous inequality in\\nthe House of Representatives. From this quarter, we are alarmed with the\\namazing expense, from the number of persons who are to administer\\nthe new government. From another quarter, and sometimes from the same\\nquarter, on another occasion, the cry is that the Congress will be but\\na shadow of a representation, and that the government would be far less\\nobjectionable if the number and the expense were doubled. A patriot in\\na State that does not import or export, discerns insuperable objections\\nagainst the power of direct taxation. The patriotic adversary in a State\\nof great exports and imports, is not less dissatisfied that the whole\\nburden of taxes may be thrown on consumption. This politician discovers\\nin the Constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy; that\\nis equally sure it will end in aristocracy. Another is puzzled to say\\nwhich of these shapes it will ultimately assume, but sees clearly it\\nmust be one or other of them; whilst a fourth is not wanting, who with\\nno less confidence affirms that the Constitution is so far from having a\\nbias towards either of these dangers, that the weight on that side\\nwill not be sufficient to keep it upright and firm against its opposite\\npropensities. With another class of adversaries to the Constitution the\\nlanguage is that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments\\nare intermixed in such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of\\nregular government and all the requisite precautions in favor of\\nliberty. Whilst this objection circulates in vague and general\\nexpressions, there are but a few who lend their sanction to it. Let each\\none come forward with his particular explanation, and scarce any two are\\nexactly agreed upon the subject. In the eyes of one the junction of the\\nSenate with the President in the responsible function of appointing to\\noffices, instead of vesting this executive power in the Executive alone,\\nis the vicious part of the organization. To another, the exclusion\\nof the House of Representatives, whose numbers alone could be a due\\nsecurity against corruption and partiality in the exercise of such\\na power, is equally obnoxious. With another, the admission of the\\nPresident into any share of a power which ever must be a dangerous\\nengine in the hands of the executive magistrate, is an unpardonable\\nviolation of the maxims of republican jealousy. No part of the\\narrangement, according to some, is more inadmissible than the trial of\\nimpeachments by the Senate, which is alternately a member both of the\\nlegislative and executive departments, when this power so evidently\\nbelonged to the judiciary department. \"We concur fully,\" reply others,\\n\"in the objection to this part of the plan, but we can never agree\\nthat a reference of impeachments to the judiciary authority would be an\\namendment of the error. Our principal dislike to the organization arises\\nfrom the extensive powers already lodged in that department.\" Even\\namong the zealous patrons of a council of state the most irreconcilable\\nvariance is discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be\\nconstituted. The demand of one gentleman is, that the council should\\nconsist of a small number to be appointed by the most numerous branch of\\nthe legislature. Another would prefer a larger number, and considers it\\nas a fundamental condition that the appointment should be made by the\\nPresident himself.\\n\\nAs it can give no umbrage to the writers against the plan of the federal\\nConstitution, let us suppose, that as they are the most zealous, so they\\nare also the most sagacious, of those who think the late convention\\nwere unequal to the task assigned them, and that a wiser and better plan\\nmight and ought to be substituted. Let us further suppose that their\\ncountry should concur, both in this favorable opinion of their\\nmerits, and in their unfavorable opinion of the convention; and should\\naccordingly proceed to form them into a second convention, with full\\npowers, and for the express purpose of revising and remoulding the\\nwork of the first. Were the experiment to be seriously made, though it\\nrequired some effort to view it seriously even in fiction, I leave it to\\nbe decided by the sample of opinions just exhibited, whether, with all\\ntheir enmity to their predecessors, they would, in any one point, depart\\nso widely from their example, as in the discord and ferment that would\\nmark their own deliberations; and whether the Constitution, now before\\nthe public, would not stand as fair a chance for immortality, as\\nLycurgus gave to that of Sparta, by making its change to depend on his\\nown return from exile and death, if it were to be immediately adopted,\\nand were to continue in force, not until a BETTER, but until ANOTHER\\nshould be agreed upon by this new assembly of lawgivers.\\n\\nIt is a matter both of wonder and regret, that those who raise so many\\nobjections against the new Constitution should never call to mind the\\ndefects of that which is to be exchanged for it. It is not necessary\\nthat the former should be perfect; it is sufficient that the latter is\\nmore imperfect. No man would refuse to give brass for silver or gold,\\nbecause the latter had some alloy in it. No man would refuse to quit a\\nshattered and tottering habitation for a firm and commodious building,\\nbecause the latter had not a porch to it, or because some of the rooms\\nmight be a little larger or smaller, or the ceilings a little higher or\\nlower than his fancy would have planned them. But waiving illustrations\\nof this sort, is it not manifest that most of the capital objections\\nurged against the new system lie with tenfold weight against the\\nexisting Confederation? Is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous\\nin the hands of the federal government? The present Congress can\\nmake requisitions to any amount they please, and the States are\\nconstitutionally bound to furnish them; they can emit bills of credit as\\nlong as they will pay for the paper; they can borrow, both abroad and\\nat home, as long as a shilling will be lent. Is an indefinite power to\\nraise troops dangerous? The Confederation gives to Congress that power\\nalso; and they have already begun to make use of it. Is it improper and\\nunsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body\\nof men? Congress, a single body of men, are the sole depositary of all\\nthe federal powers. Is it particularly dangerous to give the keys of\\nthe treasury, and the command of the army, into the same hands? The\\nConfederation places them both in the hands of Congress. Is a bill of\\nrights essential to liberty? The Confederation has no bill of rights.\\nIs it an objection against the new Constitution, that it empowers the\\nSenate, with the concurrence of the Executive, to make treaties which\\nare to be the laws of the land? The existing Congress, without any such\\ncontrol, can make treaties which they themselves have declared, and most\\nof the States have recognized, to be the supreme law of the land. Is\\nthe importation of slaves permitted by the new Constitution for twenty\\nyears? By the old it is permitted forever.\\n\\nI shall be told, that however dangerous this mixture of powers may be\\nin theory, it is rendered harmless by the dependence of Congress on the\\nState for the means of carrying them into practice; that however large\\nthe mass of powers may be, it is in fact a lifeless mass. Then, say I,\\nin the first place, that the Confederation is chargeable with the still\\ngreater folly of declaring certain powers in the federal government to\\nbe absolutely necessary, and at the same time rendering them absolutely\\nnugatory; and, in the next place, that if the Union is to continue, and\\nno better government be substituted, effective powers must either be\\ngranted to, or assumed by, the existing Congress; in either of which\\nevents, the contrast just stated will hold good. But this is not all.\\nOut of this lifeless mass has already grown an excrescent power,\\nwhich tends to realize all the dangers that can be apprehended from a\\ndefective construction of the supreme government of the Union. It is now\\nno longer a point of speculation and hope, that the Western territory\\nis a mine of vast wealth to the United States; and although it is not of\\nsuch a nature as to extricate them from their present distresses, or\\nfor some time to come, to yield any regular supplies for the public\\nexpenses, yet must it hereafter be able, under proper management, both\\nto effect a gradual discharge of the domestic debt, and to furnish, for\\na certain period, liberal tributes to the federal treasury. A very\\nlarge proportion of this fund has been already surrendered by individual\\nStates; and it may with reason be expected that the remaining States\\nwill not persist in withholding similar proofs of their equity and\\ngenerosity. We may calculate, therefore, that a rich and fertile\\ncountry, of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the United\\nStates, will soon become a national stock. Congress have assumed the\\nadministration of this stock. They have begun to render it productive.\\nCongress have undertaken to do more: they have proceeded to form new\\nStates, to erect temporary governments, to appoint officers for them,\\nand to prescribe the conditions on which such States shall be admitted\\ninto the Confederacy. All this has been done; and done without the least\\ncolor of constitutional authority. Yet no blame has been whispered;\\nno alarm has been sounded. A GREAT and INDEPENDENT fund of revenue is\\npassing into the hands of a SINGLE BODY of men, who can RAISE TROOPS\\nto an INDEFINITE NUMBER, and appropriate money to their support for an\\nINDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. And yet there are men, who have not only been\\nsilent spectators of this prospect, but who are advocates for the system\\nwhich exhibits it; and, at the same time, urge against the new system\\nthe objections which we have heard. Would they not act with more\\nconsistency, in urging the establishment of the latter, as no less\\nnecessary to guard the Union against the future powers and resources of\\na body constructed like the existing Congress, than to save it from the\\ndangers threatened by the present impotency of that Assembly?\\n\\nI mean not, by any thing here said, to throw censure on the measures\\nwhich have been pursued by Congress. I am sensible they could not have\\ndone otherwise. The public interest, the necessity of the case, imposed\\nupon them the task of overleaping their constitutional limits. But is\\nnot the fact an alarming proof of the danger resulting from a government\\nwhich does not possess regular powers commensurate to its objects?\\nA dissolution or usurpation is the dreadful dilemma to which it is\\ncontinually exposed.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 39\\n\\nThe Conformity of the Plan to Republican Principles\\n\\nFor the Independent Journal. Wednesday, January 16, 1788\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nTHE last paper having concluded the observations which were meant to\\nintroduce a candid survey of the plan of government reported by\\nthe convention, we now proceed to the execution of that part of our\\nundertaking.\\n\\nThe first question that offers itself is, whether the general form and\\naspect of the government be strictly republican. It is evident that\\nno other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of\\nAmerica; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with that\\nhonorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to\\nrest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for\\nself-government. If the plan of the convention, therefore, be found to\\ndepart from the republican character, its advocates must abandon it as\\nno longer defensible.\\n\\nWhat, then, are the distinctive characters of the republican form? Were\\nan answer to this question to be sought, not by recurring to principles,\\nbut in the application of the term by political writers, to the\\nconstitution of different States, no satisfactory one would ever be\\nfound. Holland, in which no particle of the supreme authority is derived\\nfrom the people, has passed almost universally under the denomination of\\na republic. The same title has been bestowed on Venice, where absolute\\npower over the great body of the people is exercised, in the most\\nabsolute manner, by a small body of hereditary nobles. Poland, which is\\na mixture of aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms, has been\\ndignified with the same appellation. The government of England, which\\nhas one republican branch only, combined with an hereditary aristocracy\\nand monarchy, has, with equal impropriety, been frequently placed on\\nthe list of republics. These examples, which are nearly as dissimilar\\nto each other as to a genuine republic, show the extreme inaccuracy with\\nwhich the term has been used in political disquisitions.\\n\\nIf we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which\\ndifferent forms of government are established, we may define a republic\\nto be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives\\nall its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people,\\nand is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure,\\nfor a limited period, or during good behavior. It is ESSENTIAL to such\\na government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not\\nfrom an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise\\na handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a\\ndelegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans,\\nand claim for their government the honorable title of republic. It is\\nSUFFICIENT for such a government that the persons administering it be\\nappointed, either directly or indirectly, by the people; and that\\nthey hold their appointments by either of the tenures just specified;\\notherwise every government in the United States, as well as every\\nother popular government that has been or can be well organized or well\\nexecuted, would be degraded from the republican character. According\\nto the constitution of every State in the Union, some or other of the\\nofficers of government are appointed indirectly only by the people.\\nAccording to most of them, the chief magistrate himself is so appointed.\\nAnd according to one, this mode of appointment is extended to one of\\nthe co-ordinate branches of the legislature. According to all the\\nconstitutions, also, the tenure of the highest offices is extended to a\\ndefinite period, and in many instances, both within the legislative and\\nexecutive departments, to a period of years. According to the provisions\\nof most of the constitutions, again, as well as according to the most\\nrespectable and received opinions on the subject, the members of the\\njudiciary department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of\\ngood behavior.\\n\\nOn comparing the Constitution planned by the convention with the\\nstandard here fixed, we perceive at once that it is, in the most rigid\\nsense, conformable to it. The House of Representatives, like that of one\\nbranch at least of all the State legislatures, is elected immediately by\\nthe great body of the people. The Senate, like the present Congress,\\nand the Senate of Maryland, derives its appointment indirectly from\\nthe people. The President is indirectly derived from the choice of the\\npeople, according to the example in most of the States. Even the judges,\\nwith all other officers of the Union, will, as in the several States,\\nbe the choice, though a remote choice, of the people themselves, the\\nduration of the appointments is equally conformable to the republican\\nstandard, and to the model of State constitutions The House of\\nRepresentatives is periodically elective, as in all the States; and for\\nthe period of two years, as in the State of South Carolina. The Senate\\nis elective, for the period of six years; which is but one year more\\nthan the period of the Senate of Maryland, and but two more than that\\nof the Senates of New York and Virginia. The President is to continue\\nin office for the period of four years; as in New York and Delaware, the\\nchief magistrate is elected for three years, and in South Carolina for\\ntwo years. In the other States the election is annual. In several of the\\nStates, however, no constitutional provision is made for the impeachment\\nof the chief magistrate. And in Delaware and Virginia he is not\\nimpeachable till out of office. The President of the United States is\\nimpeachable at any time during his continuance in office. The tenure\\nby which the judges are to hold their places, is, as it unquestionably\\nought to be, that of good behavior. The tenure of the ministerial\\noffices generally, will be a subject of legal regulation, conformably to\\nthe reason of the case and the example of the State constitutions.\\n\\nCould any further proof be required of the republican complexion of this\\nsystem, the most decisive one might be found in its absolute prohibition\\nof titles of nobility, both under the federal and the State governments;\\nand in its express guaranty of the republican form to each of the\\nlatter.\\n\\n\"But it was not sufficient,\" say the adversaries of the proposed\\nConstitution, \"for the convention to adhere to the republican form.\\nThey ought, with equal care, to have preserved the FEDERAL form, which\\nregards the Union as a CONFEDERACY of sovereign states; instead of\\nwhich, they have framed a NATIONAL government, which regards the Union\\nas a CONSOLIDATION of the States.\" And it is asked by what authority\\nthis bold and radical innovation was undertaken? The handle which has\\nbeen made of this objection requires that it should be examined with\\nsome precision.\\n\\nWithout inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which the\\nobjection is founded, it will be necessary to a just estimate of its\\nforce, first, to ascertain the real character of the government in\\nquestion; secondly, to inquire how far the convention were authorized\\nto propose such a government; and thirdly, how far the duty they owed to\\ntheir country could supply any defect of regular authority.\\n\\nFirst. In order to ascertain the real character of the government, it\\nmay be considered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be\\nestablished; to the sources from which its ordinary powers are to be\\ndrawn; to the operation of those powers; to the extent of them; and\\nto the authority by which future changes in the government are to be\\nintroduced.\\n\\nOn examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that the\\nConstitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the\\npeople of America, given by deputies elected for the special purpose;\\nbut, on the other, that this assent and ratification is to be given\\nby the people, not as individuals composing one entire nation, but as\\ncomposing the distinct and independent States to which they respectively\\nbelong. It is to be the assent and ratification of the several States,\\nderived from the supreme authority in each State, the authority of the\\npeople themselves. The act, therefore, establishing the Constitution,\\nwill not be a NATIONAL, but a FEDERAL act.\\n\\nThat it will be a federal and not a national act, as these terms are\\nunderstood by the objectors; the act of the people, as forming so many\\nindependent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is obvious\\nfrom this single consideration, that it is to result neither from the\\ndecision of a MAJORITY of the people of the Union, nor from that of a\\nMAJORITY of the States. It must result from the UNANIMOUS assent of the\\nseveral States that are parties to it, differing no otherwise from their\\nordinary assent than in its being expressed, not by the legislative\\nauthority, but by that of the people themselves. Were the people\\nregarded in this transaction as forming one nation, the will of the\\nmajority of the whole people of the United States would bind the\\nminority, in the same manner as the majority in each State must bind the\\nminority; and the will of the majority must be determined either by a\\ncomparison of the individual votes, or by considering the will of the\\nmajority of the States as evidence of the will of a majority of the\\npeople of the United States. Neither of these rules have been adopted.\\nEach State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign\\nbody, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own\\nvoluntary act. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if\\nestablished, be a FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.\\n\\nThe next relation is, to the sources from which the ordinary powers of\\ngovernment are to be derived. The House of Representatives will\\nderive its powers from the people of America; and the people will be\\nrepresented in the same proportion, and on the same principle, as they\\nare in the legislature of a particular State. So far the government is\\nNATIONAL, not FEDERAL. The Senate, on the other hand, will derive its\\npowers from the States, as political and coequal societies; and these\\nwill be represented on the principle of equality in the Senate, as they\\nnow are in the existing Congress. So far the government is FEDERAL,\\nnot NATIONAL. The executive power will be derived from a very compound\\nsource. The immediate election of the President is to be made by the\\nStates in their political characters. The votes allotted to them are in\\na compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and coequal\\nsocieties, partly as unequal members of the same society. The eventual\\nelection, again, is to be made by that branch of the legislature which\\nconsists of the national representatives; but in this particular act\\nthey are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations, from\\nso many distinct and coequal bodies politic. From this aspect of the\\ngovernment it appears to be of a mixed character, presenting at least as\\nmany FEDERAL as NATIONAL features.\\n\\nThe difference between a federal and national government, as it relates\\nto the OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, is supposed to consist in this, that\\nin the former the powers operate on the political bodies composing\\nthe Confederacy, in their political capacities; in the latter, on\\nthe individual citizens composing the nation, in their individual\\ncapacities. On trying the Constitution by this criterion, it falls\\nunder the NATIONAL, not the FEDERAL character; though perhaps not so\\ncompletely as has been understood. In several cases, and particularly in\\nthe trial of controversies to which States may be parties, they must\\nbe viewed and proceeded against in their collective and political\\ncapacities only. So far the national countenance of the government on\\nthis side seems to be disfigured by a few federal features. But this\\nblemish is perhaps unavoidable in any plan; and the operation of\\nthe government on the people, in their individual capacities, in its\\nordinary and most essential proceedings, may, on the whole, designate\\nit, in this relation, a NATIONAL government.\\n\\nBut if the government be national with regard to the OPERATION of its\\npowers, it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation\\nto the EXTENT of its powers. The idea of a national government involves\\nin it, not only an authority over the individual citizens, but an\\nindefinite supremacy over all persons and things, so far as they are\\nobjects of lawful government. Among a people consolidated into one\\nnation, this supremacy is completely vested in the national legislature.\\nAmong communities united for particular purposes, it is vested partly\\nin the general and partly in the municipal legislatures. In the former\\ncase, all local authorities are subordinate to the supreme; and may be\\ncontrolled, directed, or abolished by it at pleasure. In the latter, the\\nlocal or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of\\nthe supremacy, no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the\\ngeneral authority, than the general authority is subject to them, within\\nits own sphere. In this relation, then, the proposed government cannot\\nbe deemed a NATIONAL one; since its jurisdiction extends to certain\\nenumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a residuary\\nand inviolable sovereignty over all other objects. It is true that in\\ncontroversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions,\\nthe tribunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be established under\\nthe general government. But this does not change the principle of the\\ncase. The decision is to be impartially made, according to the rules of\\nthe Constitution; and all the usual and most effectual precautions\\nare taken to secure this impartiality. Some such tribunal is clearly\\nessential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the\\ncompact; and that it ought to be established under the general rather\\nthan under the local governments, or, to speak more properly, that it\\ncould be safely established under the first alone, is a position not\\nlikely to be combated.\\n\\nIf we try the Constitution by its last relation to the authority by\\nwhich amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly NATIONAL\\nnor wholly FEDERAL. Were it wholly national, the supreme and ultimate\\nauthority would reside in the MAJORITY of the people of the Union; and\\nthis authority would be competent at all times, like that of a\\nmajority of every national society, to alter or abolish its established\\ngovernment. Were it wholly federal, on the other hand, the concurrence\\nof each State in the Union would be essential to every alteration that\\nwould be binding on all. The mode provided by the plan of the convention\\nis not founded on either of these principles. In requiring more than\\na majority, and principles. In requiring more than a majority, and\\nparticularly in computing the proportion by STATES, not by CITIZENS, it\\ndeparts from the NATIONAL and advances towards the FEDERAL character;\\nin rendering the concurrence of less than the whole number of States\\nsufficient, it loses again the FEDERAL and partakes of the NATIONAL\\ncharacter.\\n\\nThe proposed Constitution, therefore, is, in strictness, neither a\\nnational nor a federal Constitution, but a composition of both. In its\\nfoundation it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the\\nordinary powers of the government are drawn, it is partly federal and\\npartly national; in the operation of these powers, it is national, not\\nfederal; in the extent of them, again, it is federal, not national;\\nand, finally, in the authoritative mode of introducing amendments, it is\\nneither wholly federal nor wholly national.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 40\\n\\nOn the Powers of the Convention to Form a Mixed Government Examined and\\nSustained For the New York Packet. Friday, January 18, 1788.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nTHE SECOND point to be examined is, whether the convention were\\nauthorized to frame and propose this mixed Constitution.\\n\\nThe powers of the convention ought, in strictness, to be determined\\nby an inspection of the commissions given to the members by their\\nrespective constituents. As all of these, however, had reference, either\\nto the recommendation from the meeting at Annapolis, in September, 1786,\\nor to that from Congress, in February, 1787, it will be sufficient to\\nrecur to these particular acts.\\n\\nThe act from Annapolis recommends the \"appointment of commissioners to\\ntake into consideration the situation of the United States; to devise\\nSUCH FURTHER PROVISIONS as shall appear to them necessary to render the\\nConstitution of the federal government ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF THE\\nUNION; and to report such an act for that purpose, to the United\\nStates in Congress assembled, as when agreed to by them, and afterwards\\nconfirmed by the legislature of every State, will effectually provide\\nfor the same.\"\\n\\nThe recommendatory act of Congress is in the words following: \"WHEREAS,\\nThere is provision in the articles of Confederation and perpetual Union,\\nfor making alterations therein, by the assent of a Congress of the\\nUnited States, and of the legislatures of the several States; and\\nwhereas experience hath evinced, that there are defects in the present\\nConfederation; as a mean to remedy which, several of the States, and\\nPARTICULARLY THE STATE OF NEW YORK, by express instructions to their\\ndelegates in Congress, have suggested a convention for the purposes\\nexpressed in the following resolution; and such convention appearing\\nto be the most probable mean of establishing in these States A FIRM\\nNATIONAL GOVERNMENT:\\n\\n\"Resolved, That in the opinion of Congress it is expedient, that on the\\nsecond Monday of May next a convention of delegates, who shall have been\\nappointed by the several States, be held at Philadelphia, for the sole\\nand express purpose OF REVISING THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, and\\nreporting to Congress and the several legislatures such ALTERATIONS AND\\nPROVISIONS THEREIN, as shall, when agreed to in Congress, and confirmed\\nby the States, render the federal Constitution ADEQUATE TO THE\\nEXIGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION.\"\\n\\nFrom these two acts, it appears, 1st, that the object of the convention\\nwas to establish, in these States, A FIRM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT; 2d, that\\nthis government was to be such as would be ADEQUATE TO THE EXIGENCIES\\nOF GOVERNMENT and THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION; 3d, that these purposes\\nwere to be effected by ALTERATIONS AND PROVISIONS IN THE ARTICLES OF\\nCONFEDERATION, as it is expressed in the act of Congress, or by SUCH\\nFURTHER PROVISIONS AS SHOULD APPEAR NECESSARY, as it stands in the\\nrecommendatory act from Annapolis; 4th, that the alterations and\\nprovisions were to be reported to Congress, and to the States, in order\\nto be agreed to by the former and confirmed by the latter.\\n\\nFrom a comparison and fair construction of these several modes of\\nexpression, is to be deduced the authority under which the convention\\nacted. They were to frame a NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, adequate to the\\nEXIGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT, and OF THE UNION; and to reduce the articles\\nof Confederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes.\\n\\nThere are two rules of construction, dictated by plain reason, as\\nwell as founded on legal axioms. The one is, that every part of the\\nexpression ought, if possible, to be allowed some meaning, and be made\\nto conspire to some common end. The other is, that where the several\\nparts cannot be made to coincide, the less important should give way\\nto the more important part; the means should be sacrificed to the end,\\nrather than the end to the means.\\n\\nSuppose, then, that the expressions defining the authority of the\\nconvention were irreconcilably at variance with each other; that a\\nNATIONAL and ADEQUATE GOVERNMENT could not possibly, in the judgment\\nof the convention, be affected by ALTERATIONS and PROVISIONS in the\\nARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION; which part of the definition ought to have\\nbeen embraced, and which rejected? Which was the more important, which\\nthe less important part? Which the end; which the means? Let the most\\nscrupulous expositors of delegated powers; let the most inveterate\\nobjectors against those exercised by the convention, answer these\\nquestions. Let them declare, whether it was of most importance to the\\nhappiness of the people of America, that the articles of Confederation\\nshould be disregarded, and an adequate government be provided, and the\\nUnion preserved; or that an adequate government should be omitted, and\\nthe articles of Confederation preserved. Let them declare, whether the\\npreservation of these articles was the end, for securing which a reform\\nof the government was to be introduced as the means; or whether the\\nestablishment of a government, adequate to the national happiness, was\\nthe end at which these articles themselves originally aimed, and to\\nwhich they ought, as insufficient means, to have been sacrificed.\\n\\nBut is it necessary to suppose that these expressions are absolutely\\nirreconcilable to each other; that no ALTERATIONS or PROVISIONS in the\\narticles of the confederation could possibly mould them into a national\\nand adequate government; into such a government as has been proposed by\\nthe convention?\\n\\nNo stress, it is presumed, will, in this case, be laid on the TITLE;\\na change of that could never be deemed an exercise of ungranted power.\\nALTERATIONS in the body of the instrument are expressly authorized. NEW\\nPROVISIONS therein are also expressly authorized. Here then is a power\\nto change the title; to insert new articles; to alter old ones. Must it\\nof necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part\\nof the old articles remain? Those who maintain the affirmative ought at\\nleast to mark the boundary between authorized and usurped innovations;\\nbetween that degree of change which lies within the compass of\\nALTERATIONS AND FURTHER PROVISIONS, and that which amounts to a\\nTRANSMUTATION of the government. Will it be said that the alterations\\nought not to have touched the substance of the Confederation? The States\\nwould never have appointed a convention with so much solemnity, nor\\ndescribed its objects with so much latitude, if some SUBSTANTIAL reform\\nhad not been in contemplation. Will it be said that the FUNDAMENTAL\\nPRINCIPLES of the Confederation were not within the purview of the\\nconvention, and ought not to have been varied? I ask, What are\\nthese principles? Do they require that, in the establishment of the\\nConstitution, the States should be regarded as distinct and independent\\nsovereigns? They are so regarded by the Constitution proposed. Do\\nthey require that the members of the government should derive their\\nappointment from the legislatures, not from the people of the\\nStates? One branch of the new government is to be appointed by these\\nlegislatures; and under the Confederation, the delegates to Congress\\nMAY ALL be appointed immediately by the people, and in two States(1) are\\nactually so appointed. Do they require that the powers of the government\\nshould act on the States, and not immediately on individuals? In some\\ninstances, as has been shown, the powers of the new government will act\\non the States in their collective characters. In some instances, also,\\nthose of the existing government act immediately on individuals. In\\ncases of capture; of piracy; of the post office; of coins, weights, and\\nmeasures; of trade with the Indians; of claims under grants of land\\nby different States; and, above all, in the case of trials by\\ncourts-marshal in the army and navy, by which death may be inflicted\\nwithout the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil magistrate; in\\nall these cases the powers of the Confederation operate immediately on\\nthe persons and interests of individual citizens. Do these fundamental\\nprinciples require, particularly, that no tax should be levied without\\nthe intermediate agency of the States? The Confederation itself\\nauthorizes a direct tax, to a certain extent, on the post office. The\\npower of coinage has been so construed by Congress as to levy a tribute\\nimmediately from that source also. But pretermitting these instances,\\nwas it not an acknowledged object of the convention and the universal\\nexpectation of the people, that the regulation of trade should be\\nsubmitted to the general government in such a form as would render it\\nan immediate source of general revenue? Had not Congress repeatedly\\nrecommended this measure as not inconsistent with the fundamental\\nprinciples of the Confederation? Had not every State but one; had\\nnot New York herself, so far complied with the plan of Congress as to\\nrecognize the PRINCIPLE of the innovation? Do these principles, in fine,\\nrequire that the powers of the general government should be limited,\\nand that, beyond this limit, the States should be left in possession\\nof their sovereignty and independence? We have seen that in the new\\ngovernment, as in the old, the general powers are limited; and that the\\nStates, in all unenumerated cases, are left in the enjoyment of their\\nsovereign and independent jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe truth is, that the great principles of the Constitution proposed\\nby the convention may be considered less as absolutely new, than as\\nthe expansion of principles which are found in the articles of\\nConfederation. The misfortune under the latter system has been, that\\nthese principles are so feeble and confined as to justify all the\\ncharges of inefficiency which have been urged against it, and to require\\na degree of enlargement which gives to the new system the aspect of an\\nentire transformation of the old.\\n\\nIn one particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from\\nthe tenor of their commission. Instead of reporting a plan requiring the\\nconfirmation OF THE LEGISLATURES OF ALL THE STATES, they have reported\\na plan which is to be confirmed by the PEOPLE, and may be carried into\\neffect by NINE STATES ONLY. It is worthy of remark that this objection,\\nthough the most plausible, has been the least urged in the publications\\nwhich have swarmed against the convention. The forbearance can only have\\nproceeded from an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting\\nthe fate of twelve States to the perverseness or corruption of a\\nthirteenth; from the example of inflexible opposition given by a\\nMAJORITY of one sixtieth of the people of America to a measure approved\\nand called for by the voice of twelve States, comprising fifty-nine\\nsixtieths of the people an example still fresh in the memory and\\nindignation of every citizen who has felt for the wounded honor and\\nprosperity of his country. As this objection, therefore, has been in a\\nmanner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention,\\nI dismiss it without further observation.\\n\\nThe THIRD point to be inquired into is, how far considerations of duty\\narising out of the case itself could have supplied any defect of regular\\nauthority.\\n\\nIn the preceding inquiries the powers of the convention have been\\nanalyzed and tried with the same rigor, and by the same rules, as\\nif they had been real and final powers for the establishment of a\\nConstitution for the United States. We have seen in what manner they\\nhave borne the trial even on that supposition. It is time now to\\nrecollect that the powers were merely advisory and recommendatory; that\\nthey were so meant by the States, and so understood by the convention;\\nand that the latter have accordingly planned and proposed a Constitution\\nwhich is to be of no more consequence than the paper on which it is\\nwritten, unless it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom\\nit is addressed. This reflection places the subject in a point of view\\naltogether different, and will enable us to judge with propriety of the\\ncourse taken by the convention.\\n\\nLet us view the ground on which the convention stood. It may be\\ncollected from their proceedings, that they were deeply and unanimously\\nimpressed with the crisis, which had led their country almost with one\\nvoice to make so singular and solemn an experiment for correcting the\\nerrors of a system by which this crisis had been produced; that they\\nwere no less deeply and unanimously convinced that such a reform as they\\nhave proposed was absolutely necessary to effect the purposes of\\ntheir appointment. It could not be unknown to them that the hopes\\nand expectations of the great body of citizens, throughout this great\\nempire, were turned with the keenest anxiety to the event of their\\ndeliberations. They had every reason to believe that the contrary\\nsentiments agitated the minds and bosoms of every external and internal\\nfoe to the liberty and prosperity of the United States. They had seen in\\nthe origin and progress of the experiment, the alacrity with which\\nthe PROPOSITION, made by a single State (Virginia), towards a partial\\namendment of the Confederation, had been attended to and promoted. They\\nhad seen the LIBERTY ASSUMED by a VERY FEW deputies from a VERY FEW\\nStates, convened at Annapolis, of recommending a great and critical\\nobject, wholly foreign to their commission, not only justified by the\\npublic opinion, but actually carried into effect by twelve out of the\\nthirteen States. They had seen, in a variety of instances, assumptions\\nby Congress, not only of recommendatory, but of operative, powers,\\nwarranted, in the public estimation, by occasions and objects infinitely\\nless urgent than those by which their conduct was to be governed.\\nThey must have reflected, that in all great changes of established\\ngovernments, forms ought to give way to substance; that a rigid\\nadherence in such cases to the former, would render nominal and nugatory\\nthe transcendent and precious right of the people to \"abolish or alter\\ntheir governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their\\nsafety and happiness,\"(2) since it is impossible for the people\\nspontaneously and universally to move in concert towards their object;\\nand it is therefore essential that such changes be instituted by some\\nINFORMAL AND UNAUTHORIZED PROPOSITIONS, made by some patriotic and\\nrespectable citizen or number of citizens. They must have recollected\\nthat it was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the\\npeople plans for their safety and happiness, that the States were first\\nunited against the danger with which they were threatened by their\\nancient government; that committees and congresses were formed for\\nconcentrating their efforts and defending their rights; and that\\nCONVENTIONS were ELECTED in THE SEVERAL STATES for establishing the\\nconstitutions under which they are now governed; nor could it have been\\nforgotten that no little ill-timed scruples, no zeal for adhering\\nto ordinary forms, were anywhere seen, except in those who wished\\nto indulge, under these masks, their secret enmity to the substance\\ncontended for. They must have borne in mind, that as the plan to be\\nframed and proposed was to be submitted TO THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, the\\ndisapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it forever; its\\napprobation blot out antecedent errors and irregularities. It might\\neven have occurred to them, that where a disposition to cavil prevailed,\\ntheir neglect to execute the degree of power vested in them, and still\\nmore their recommendation of any measure whatever, not warranted\\nby their commission, would not less excite animadversion, than a\\nrecommendation at once of a measure fully commensurate to the national\\nexigencies.\\n\\nHad the convention, under all these impressions, and in the midst of all\\nthese considerations, instead of exercising a manly confidence in their\\ncountry, by whose confidence they had been so peculiarly distinguished,\\nand of pointing out a system capable, in their judgment, of securing\\nits happiness, taken the cold and sullen resolution of disappointing\\nits ardent hopes, of sacrificing substance to forms, of committing the\\ndearest interests of their country to the uncertainties of delay and\\nthe hazard of events, let me ask the man who can raise his mind to one\\nelevated conception, who can awaken in his bosom one patriotic emotion,\\nwhat judgment ought to have been pronounced by the impartial world, by\\nthe friends of mankind, by every virtuous citizen, on the conduct and\\ncharacter of this assembly? Or if there be a man whose propensity to\\ncondemn is susceptible of no control, let me then ask what sentence he\\nhas in reserve for the twelve States who USURPED THE POWER of\\nsending deputies to the convention, a body utterly unknown to their\\nconstitutions; for Congress, who recommended the appointment of this\\nbody, equally unknown to the Confederation; and for the State of New\\nYork, in particular, which first urged and then complied with this\\nunauthorized interposition?\\n\\nBut that the objectors may be disarmed of every pretext, it shall be\\ngranted for a moment that the convention were neither authorized\\nby their commission, nor justified by circumstances in proposing a\\nConstitution for their country: does it follow that the Constitution\\nought, for that reason alone, to be rejected? If, according to the noble\\nprecept, it be lawful to accept good advice even from an enemy, shall we\\nset the ignoble example of refusing such advice even when it is offered\\nby our friends? The prudent inquiry, in all cases, ought surely to be,\\nnot so much FROM WHOM the advice comes, as whether the advice be GOOD.\\n\\nThe sum of what has been here advanced and proved is, that the charge\\nagainst the convention of exceeding their powers, except in one instance\\nlittle urged by the objectors, has no foundation to support it; that\\nif they had exceeded their powers, they were not only warranted,\\nbut required, as the confidential servants of their country, by the\\ncircumstances in which they were placed, to exercise the liberty which\\nthey assume; and that finally, if they had violated both their\\npowers and their obligations, in proposing a Constitution, this ought\\nnevertheless to be embraced, if it be calculated to accomplish the views\\nand happiness of the people of America. How far this character is due to\\nthe Constitution, is the subject under investigation.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n1. Connecticut and Rhode Island.\\n\\n2. Declaration of Independence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 41\\n\\nGeneral View of the Powers Conferred by The Constitution\\n\\nFor the Independent Journal. Saturday, January 19, 1788\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nTHE Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered under\\ntwo general points of view. The FIRST relates to the sum or quantity of\\npower which it vests in the government, including the restraints\\nimposed on the States. The SECOND, to the particular structure of\\nthe government, and the distribution of this power among its several\\nbranches.\\n\\nUnder the FIRST view of the subject, two important questions arise: 1.\\nWhether any part of the powers transferred to the general government be\\nunnecessary or improper? 2. Whether the entire mass of them be dangerous\\nto the portion of jurisdiction left in the several States?\\n\\nIs the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to\\nhave been vested in it? This is the FIRST question.\\n\\nIt cannot have escaped those who have attended with candor to the\\narguments employed against the extensive powers of the government, that\\nthe authors of them have very little considered how far these powers\\nwere necessary means of attaining a necessary end. They have chosen\\nrather to dwell on the inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended\\nwith all political advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be\\nincident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can be made.\\nThis method of handling the subject cannot impose on the good sense of\\nthe people of America. It may display the subtlety of the writer; it may\\nopen a boundless field for rhetoric and declamation; it may inflame\\nthe passions of the unthinking, and may confirm the prejudices of the\\nmisthinking: but cool and candid people will at once reflect, that the\\npurest of human blessings must have a portion of alloy in them; that the\\nchoice must always be made, if not of the lesser evil, at least of the\\nGREATER, not the PERFECT, good; and that in every political institution,\\na power to advance the public happiness involves a discretion which may\\nbe misapplied and abused. They will see, therefore, that in all cases\\nwhere power is to be conferred, the point first to be decided is,\\nwhether such a power be necessary to the public good; as the next will\\nbe, in case of an affirmative decision, to guard as effectually as\\npossible against a perversion of the power to the public detriment.\\n\\nThat we may form a correct judgment on this subject, it will be proper\\nto review the several powers conferred on the government of the Union;\\nand that this may be the more conveniently done they may be reduced into\\ndifferent classes as they relate to the following different objects: 1.\\nSecurity against foreign danger; 2. Regulation of the intercourse with\\nforeign nations; 3. Maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among\\nthe States; 4. Certain miscellaneous objects of general utility; 5.\\nRestraint of the States from certain injurious acts; 6. Provisions for\\ngiving due efficacy to all these powers.\\n\\nThe powers falling within the FIRST class are those of declaring war\\nand granting letters of marque; of providing armies and fleets; of\\nregulating and calling forth the militia; of levying and borrowing\\nmoney.\\n\\nSecurity against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil\\nsociety. It is an avowed and essential object of the American Union. The\\npowers requisite for attaining it must be effectually confided to the\\nfederal councils.\\n\\nIs the power of declaring war necessary? No man will answer this\\nquestion in the negative. It would be superfluous, therefore, to enter\\ninto a proof of the affirmative. The existing Confederation establishes\\nthis power in the most ample form.\\n\\nIs the power of raising armies and equipping fleets necessary? This\\nis involved in the foregoing power. It is involved in the power of\\nself-defense.\\n\\nBut was it necessary to give an INDEFINITE POWER of raising TROOPS, as\\nwell as providing fleets; and of maintaining both in PEACE, as well as\\nin WAR?\\n\\nThe answer to these questions has been too far anticipated in another\\nplace to admit an extensive discussion of them in this place. The answer\\nindeed seems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such\\na discussion in any place. With what color of propriety could the force\\nnecessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force\\nof offense? If a federal Constitution could chain the ambition or set\\nbounds to the exertions of all other nations, then indeed might it\\nprudently chain the discretion of its own government, and set bounds to\\nthe exertions for its own safety.\\n\\nHow could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited,\\nunless we could prohibit, in like manner, the preparations and\\nestablishments of every hostile nation? The means of security can only\\nbe regulated by the means and the danger of attack. They will, in fact,\\nbe ever determined by these rules, and by no others. It is in vain to\\noppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation.\\nIt is worse than in vain; because it plants in the Constitution itself\\nnecessary usurpations of power, every precedent of which is a germ\\nof unnecessary and multiplied repetitions. If one nation maintains\\nconstantly a disciplined army, ready for the service of ambition or\\nrevenge, it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within the reach\\nof its enterprises to take corresponding precautions. The fifteenth\\ncentury was the unhappy epoch of military establishments in the time of\\npeace. They were introduced by Charles VII. of France. All Europe has\\nfollowed, or been forced into, the example. Had the example not been\\nfollowed by other nations, all Europe must long ago have worn the chains\\nof a universal monarch. Were every nation except France now to disband\\nits peace establishments, the same event might follow. The veteran\\nlegions of Rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valor of all\\nother nations and rendered her the mistress of the world.\\n\\nNot the less true is it, that the liberties of Rome proved the final\\nvictim to her military triumphs; and that the liberties of Europe, as\\nfar as they ever existed, have, with few exceptions, been the price\\nof her military establishments. A standing force, therefore, is a\\ndangerous, at the same time that it may be a necessary, provision. On\\nthe smallest scale it has its inconveniences. On an extensive scale\\nits consequences may be fatal. On any scale it is an object of laudable\\ncircumspection and precaution. A wise nation will combine all these\\nconsiderations; and, whilst it does not rashly preclude itself from any\\nresource which may become essential to its safety, will exert all its\\nprudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting\\nto one which may be inauspicious to its liberties.\\n\\nThe clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on the proposed\\nConstitution. The Union itself, which it cements and secures, destroys\\nevery pretext for a military establishment which could be dangerous.\\nAmerica united, with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier,\\nexhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than America\\ndisunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat. It was\\nremarked, on a former occasion, that the want of this pretext had saved\\nthe liberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered by her insular\\nsituation and her maritime resources impregnable to the armies of her\\nneighbors, the rulers of Great Britain have never been able, by real\\nor artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an extensive peace\\nestablishment. The distance of the United States from the powerful\\nnations of the world gives them the same happy security. A dangerous\\nestablishment can never be necessary or plausible, so long as they\\ncontinue a united people. But let it never, for a moment, be forgotten\\nthat they are indebted for this advantage to the Union alone. The moment\\nof its dissolution will be the date of a new order of things. The fears\\nof the weaker, or the ambition of the stronger States, or Confederacies,\\nwill set the same example in the New, as Charles VII. did in the Old\\nWorld. The example will be followed here from the same motives which\\nproduced universal imitation there. Instead of deriving from our\\nsituation the precious advantage which Great Britain has derived from\\nhers, the face of America will be but a copy of that of the continent\\nof Europe. It will present liberty everywhere crushed between standing\\narmies and perpetual taxes. The fortunes of disunited America will be\\neven more disastrous than those of Europe. The sources of evil in the\\nlatter are confined to her own limits. No superior powers of another\\nquarter of the globe intrigue among her rival nations, inflame their\\nmutual animosities, and render them the instruments of foreign ambition,\\njealousy, and revenge. In America the miseries springing from her\\ninternal jealousies, contentions, and wars, would form a part only of\\nher lot. A plentiful addition of evils would have their source in that\\nrelation in which Europe stands to this quarter of the earth, and which\\nno other quarter of the earth bears to Europe.\\n\\nThis picture of the consequences of disunion cannot be too highly\\ncolored, or too often exhibited. Every man who loves peace, every man\\nwho loves his country, every man who loves liberty, ought to have it\\never before his eyes, that he may cherish in his heart a due attachment\\nto the Union of America, and be able to set a due value on the means of\\npreserving it.\\n\\nNext to the effectual establishment of the Union, the best possible\\nprecaution against danger from standing armies is a limitation of\\nthe term for which revenue may be appropriated to their support. This\\nprecaution the Constitution has prudently added. I will not repeat here\\nthe observations which I flatter myself have placed this subject in a\\njust and satisfactory light. But it may not be improper to take notice\\nof an argument against this part of the Constitution, which has been\\ndrawn from the policy and practice of Great Britain. It is said that the\\ncontinuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual vote of the\\nlegislature; whereas the American Constitution has lengthened this\\ncritical period to two years. This is the form in which the comparison\\nis usually stated to the public: but is it a just form? Is it a fair\\ncomparison? Does the British Constitution restrain the parliamentary\\ndiscretion to one year? Does the American impose on the Congress\\nappropriations for two years? On the contrary, it cannot be unknown to\\nthe authors of the fallacy themselves, that the British Constitution\\nfixes no limit whatever to the discretion of the legislature, and that\\nthe American ties down the legislature to two years, as the longest\\nadmissible term.\\n\\nHad the argument from the British example been truly stated, it would\\nhave stood thus: The term for which supplies may be appropriated to the\\narmy establishment, though unlimited by the British Constitution, has\\nnevertheless, in practice, been limited by parliamentary discretion to\\na single year. Now, if in Great Britain, where the House of Commons is\\nelected for seven years; where so great a proportion of the members are\\nelected by so small a proportion of the people; where the electors\\nare so corrupted by the representatives, and the representatives so\\ncorrupted by the Crown, the representative body can possess a power\\nto make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term, without\\ndesiring, or without daring, to extend the term beyond a single\\nyear, ought not suspicion herself to blush, in pretending that the\\nrepresentatives of the United States, elected FREELY by the WHOLE BODY\\nof the people, every SECOND YEAR, cannot be safely intrusted with the\\ndiscretion over such appropriations, expressly limited to the short\\nperiod of TWO YEARS?\\n\\nA bad cause seldom fails to betray itself. Of this truth, the\\nmanagement of the opposition to the federal government is an unvaried\\nexemplification. But among all the blunders which have been committed,\\nnone is more striking than the attempt to enlist on that side the\\nprudent jealousy entertained by the people, of standing armies. The\\nattempt has awakened fully the public attention to that important\\nsubject; and has led to investigations which must terminate in a\\nthorough and universal conviction, not only that the constitution has\\nprovided the most effectual guards against danger from that quarter,\\nbut that nothing short of a Constitution fully adequate to the national\\ndefense and the preservation of the Union, can save America from as many\\nstanding armies as it may be split into States or Confederacies, and\\nfrom such a progressive augmentation, of these establishments in each,\\nas will render them as burdensome to the properties and ominous to the\\nliberties of the people, as any establishment that can become necessary,\\nunder a united and efficient government, must be tolerable to the former\\nand safe to the latter.\\n\\nThe palpable necessity of the power to provide and maintain a navy has\\nprotected that part of the Constitution against a spirit of censure,\\nwhich has spared few other parts. It must, indeed, be numbered among the\\ngreatest blessings of America, that as her Union will be the only source\\nof her maritime strength, so this will be a principal source of her\\nsecurity against danger from abroad. In this respect our situation\\nbears another likeness to the insular advantage of Great Britain. The\\nbatteries most capable of repelling foreign enterprises on our safety,\\nare happily such as can never be turned by a perfidious government\\nagainst our liberties.\\n\\nThe inhabitants of the Atlantic frontier are all of them deeply\\ninterested in this provision for naval protection, and if they have\\nhitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds; if their\\nproperty has remained safe against the predatory spirit of licentious\\nadventurers; if their maritime towns have not yet been compelled to\\nransom themselves from the terrors of a conflagration, by yielding to\\nthe exactions of daring and sudden invaders, these instances of\\ngood fortune are not to be ascribed to the capacity of the existing\\ngovernment for the protection of those from whom it claims allegiance,\\nbut to causes that are fugitive and fallacious. If we except perhaps\\nVirginia and Maryland, which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern\\nfrontiers, no part of the Union ought to feel more anxiety on this\\nsubject than New York. Her seacoast is extensive. A very important\\ndistrict of the State is an island. The State itself is penetrated by a\\nlarge navigable river for more than fifty leagues. The great emporium\\nof its commerce, the great reservoir of its wealth, lies every moment\\nat the mercy of events, and may almost be regarded as a hostage for\\nignominious compliances with the dictates of a foreign enemy, or even\\nwith the rapacious demands of pirates and barbarians. Should a war be\\nthe result of the precarious situation of European affairs, and all the\\nunruly passions attending it be let loose on the ocean, our escape from\\ninsults and depredations, not only on that element, but every part of\\nthe other bordering on it, will be truly miraculous. In the present\\ncondition of America, the States more immediately exposed to these\\ncalamities have nothing to hope from the phantom of a general government\\nwhich now exists; and if their single resources were equal to the task\\nof fortifying themselves against the danger, the object to be protected\\nwould be almost consumed by the means of protecting them.\\n\\nThe power of regulating and calling forth the militia has been already\\nsufficiently vindicated and explained.\\n\\nThe power of levying and borrowing money, being the sinew of that which\\nis to be exerted in the national defense, is properly thrown into the\\nsame class with it. This power, also, has been examined already with\\nmuch attention, and has, I trust, been clearly shown to be necessary,\\nboth in the extent and form given to it by the Constitution. I will\\naddress one additional reflection only to those who contend that the\\npower ought to have been restrained to external--taxation by which they\\nmean, taxes on articles imported from other countries. It cannot be\\ndoubted that this will always be a valuable source of revenue; that for\\na considerable time it must be a principal source; that at this moment\\nit is an essential one. But we may form very mistaken ideas on this\\nsubject, if we do not call to mind in our calculations, that the extent\\nof revenue drawn from foreign commerce must vary with the variations,\\nboth in the extent and the kind of imports; and that these variations\\ndo not correspond with the progress of population, which must be the\\ngeneral measure of the public wants. As long as agriculture continues\\nthe sole field of labor, the importation of manufactures must increase\\nas the consumers multiply. As soon as domestic manufactures are begun by\\nthe hands not called for by agriculture, the imported manufactures will\\ndecrease as the numbers of people increase. In a more remote stage, the\\nimports may consist in a considerable part of raw materials, which will\\nbe wrought into articles for exportation, and will, therefore,\\nrequire rather the encouragement of bounties, than to be loaded with\\ndiscouraging duties. A system of government, meant for duration, ought\\nto contemplate these revolutions, and be able to accommodate itself to\\nthem.\\n\\nSome, who have not denied the necessity of the power of taxation, have\\ngrounded a very fierce attack against the Constitution, on the language\\nin which it is defined. It has been urged and echoed, that the power \"to\\nlay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts,\\nand provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United\\nStates,\" amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power\\nwhich may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general\\nwelfare. No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which\\nthese writers labor for objections, than their stooping to such a\\nmisconstruction.\\n\\nHad no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the Congress\\nbeen found in the Constitution, than the general expressions just cited,\\nthe authors of the objection might have had some color for it; though\\nit would have been difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of\\ndescribing an authority to legislate in all possible cases. A power to\\ndestroy the freedom of the press, the trial by jury, or even to regulate\\nthe course of descents, or the forms of conveyances, must be very\\nsingularly expressed by the terms \"to raise money for the general\\nwelfare.\"\\n\\nBut what color can the objection have, when a specification of the\\nobjects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows, and is\\nnot even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon? If the different\\nparts of the same instrument ought to be so expounded, as to give\\nmeaning to every part which will bear it, shall one part of the same\\nsentence be excluded altogether from a share in the meaning; and shall\\nthe more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent,\\nand the clear and precise expressions be denied any signification\\nwhatsoever? For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers\\nbe inserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the\\npreceding general power? Nothing is more natural nor common than first\\nto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital\\nof particulars. But the idea of an enumeration of particulars which\\nneither explain nor qualify the general meaning, and can have no other\\neffect than to confound and mislead, is an absurdity, which, as we\\nare reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the\\nobjection or on the authors of the Constitution, we must take the\\nliberty of supposing, had not its origin with the latter.\\n\\nThe objection here is the more extraordinary, as it appears that\\nthe language used by the convention is a copy from the articles of\\nConfederation. The objects of the Union among the States, as described\\nin article third, are \"their common defense, security of their\\nliberties, and mutual and general welfare.\" The terms of article eighth\\nare still more identical: \"All charges of war and all other expenses\\nthat shall be incurred for the common defense or general welfare, and\\nallowed by the United States in Congress, shall be defrayed out of a\\ncommon treasury,\" etc. A similar language again occurs in article ninth.\\nConstrue either of these articles by the rules which would justify the\\nconstruction put on the new Constitution, and they vest in the existing\\nCongress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever. But what would\\nhave been thought of that assembly, if, attaching themselves to these\\ngeneral expressions, and disregarding the specifications which ascertain\\nand limit their import, they had exercised an unlimited power of\\nproviding for the common defense and general welfare? I appeal to the\\nobjectors themselves, whether they would in that case have employed\\nthe same reasoning in justification of Congress as they now make use of\\nagainst the convention. How difficult it is for error to escape its own\\ncondemnation!\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 42\\n\\nThe Powers Conferred by the Constitution Further Considered\\n\\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, January 22, 1788.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nTHE SECOND class of powers, lodged in the general government, consists\\nof those which regulate the intercourse with foreign nations, to wit: to\\nmake treaties; to send and receive ambassadors, other public ministers,\\nand consuls; to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the\\nhigh seas, and offenses against the law of nations; to regulate foreign\\ncommerce, including a power to prohibit, after the year 1808, the\\nimportation of slaves, and to lay an intermediate duty of ten dollars\\nper head, as a discouragement to such importations.\\n\\nThis class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the\\nfederal administration. If we are to be one nation in any respect, it\\nclearly ought to be in respect to other nations.\\n\\nThe powers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors, speak\\ntheir own propriety. Both of them are comprised in the articles\\nof Confederation, with this difference only, that the former is\\ndisembarrassed, by the plan of the convention, of an exception, under\\nwhich treaties might be substantially frustrated by regulations of\\nthe States; and that a power of appointing and receiving \"other public\\nministers and consuls,\" is expressly and very properly added to the\\nformer provision concerning ambassadors. The term ambassador, if taken\\nstrictly, as seems to be required by the second of the articles of\\nConfederation, comprehends the highest grade only of public ministers,\\nand excludes the grades which the United States will be most likely to\\nprefer, where foreign embassies may be necessary. And under no latitude\\nof construction will the term comprehend consuls. Yet it has been found\\nexpedient, and has been the practice of Congress, to employ the inferior\\ngrades of public ministers, and to send and receive consuls.\\n\\nIt is true, that where treaties of commerce stipulate for the mutual\\nappointment of consuls, whose functions are connected with commerce,\\nthe admission of foreign consuls may fall within the power of making\\ncommercial treaties; and that where no such treaties exist, the mission\\nof American consuls into foreign countries may PERHAPS be covered under\\nthe authority, given by the ninth article of the Confederation, to\\nappoint all such civil officers as may be necessary for managing the\\ngeneral affairs of the United States. But the admission of consuls into\\nthe United States, where no previous treaty has stipulated it, seems to\\nhave been nowhere provided for. A supply of the omission is one of the\\nlesser instances in which the convention have improved on the model\\nbefore them. But the most minute provisions become important when they\\ntend to obviate the necessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved\\nusurpations of power. A list of the cases in which Congress have been\\nbetrayed, or forced by the defects of the Confederation, into violations\\nof their chartered authorities, would not a little surprise those who\\nhave paid no attention to the subject; and would be no inconsiderable\\nargument in favor of the new Constitution, which seems to have provided\\nno less studiously for the lesser, than the more obvious and striking\\ndefects of the old.\\n\\nThe power to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the\\nhigh seas, and offenses against the law of nations, belongs with equal\\npropriety to the general government, and is a still greater improvement\\non the articles of Confederation. These articles contain no provision\\nfor the case of offenses against the law of nations; and consequently\\nleave it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the\\nConfederacy with foreign nations. The provision of the federal articles\\non the subject of piracies and felonies extends no further than to the\\nestablishment of courts for the trial of these offenses. The definition\\nof piracies might, perhaps, without inconveniency, be left to the law\\nof nations; though a legislative definition of them is found in most\\nmunicipal codes. A definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently\\nrequisite. Felony is a term of loose signification, even in the common\\nlaw of England; and of various import in the statute law of that\\nkingdom. But neither the common nor the statute law of that, or of any\\nother nation, ought to be a standard for the proceedings of this, unless\\npreviously made its own by legislative adoption. The meaning of the\\nterm, as defined in the codes of the several States, would be as\\nimpracticable as the former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate\\nguide. It is not precisely the same in any two of the States; and\\nvaries in each with every revision of its criminal laws. For the sake of\\ncertainty and uniformity, therefore, the power of defining felonies in\\nthis case was in every respect necessary and proper.\\n\\nThe regulation of foreign commerce, having fallen within several views\\nwhich have been taken of this subject, has been too fully discussed\\nto need additional proofs here of its being properly submitted to the\\nfederal administration.\\n\\nIt were doubtless to be wished, that the power of prohibiting the\\nimportation of slaves had not been postponed until the year 1808, or\\nrather that it had been suffered to have immediate operation. But it\\nis not difficult to account, either for this restriction on the general\\ngovernment, or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed.\\nIt ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of humanity,\\nthat a period of twenty years may terminate forever, within these\\nStates, a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraided the\\nbarbarism of modern policy; that within that period, it will receive\\na considerable discouragement from the federal government, and may be\\ntotally abolished, by a concurrence of the few States which continue the\\nunnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example which has been given by\\nso great a majority of the Union. Happy would it be for the unfortunate\\nAfricans, if an equal prospect lay before them of being redeemed from\\nthe oppressions of their European brethren!\\n\\nAttempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection\\nagainst the Constitution, by representing it on one side as a criminal\\ntoleration of an illicit practice, and on another as calculated to\\nprevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America. I\\nmention these misconstructions, not with a view to give them an answer,\\nfor they deserve none, but as specimens of the manner and spirit in\\nwhich some have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed\\ngovernment.\\n\\nThe powers included in the THIRD class are those which provide for the\\nharmony and proper intercourse among the States.\\n\\nUnder this head might be included the particular restraints imposed\\non the authority of the States, and certain powers of the judicial\\ndepartment; but the former are reserved for a distinct class, and the\\nlatter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the structure\\nand organization of the government. I shall confine myself to a\\ncursory review of the remaining powers comprehended under this third\\ndescription, to wit: to regulate commerce among the several States and\\nthe Indian tribes; to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and\\nof foreign coin; to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the\\ncurrent coin and securities of the United States; to fix the standard of\\nweights and measures; to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and\\nuniform laws of bankruptcy, to prescribe the manner in which the public\\nacts, records, and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved,\\nand the effect they shall have in other States; and to establish post\\noffices and post roads.\\n\\nThe defect of power in the existing Confederacy to regulate the commerce\\nbetween its several members, is in the number of those which have been\\nclearly pointed out by experience. To the proofs and remarks which\\nformer papers have brought into view on this subject, it may be added\\nthat without this supplemental provision, the great and essential\\npower of regulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and\\nineffectual. A very material object of this power was the relief of the\\nStates which import and export through other States, from the improper\\ncontributions levied on them by the latter. Were these at liberty to\\nregulate the trade between State and State, it must be foreseen that\\nways would be found out to load the articles of import and export,\\nduring the passage through their jurisdiction, with duties which would\\nfall on the makers of the latter and the consumers of the former. We may\\nbe assured by past experience, that such a practice would be introduced\\nby future contrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human\\naffairs, that it would nourish unceasing animosities, and not improbably\\nterminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquillity. To\\nthose who do not view the question through the medium of passion or of\\ninterest, the desire of the commercial States to collect, in any form,\\nan indirect revenue from their uncommercial neighbors, must appear not\\nless impolitic than it is unfair; since it would stimulate the injured\\nparty, by resentment as well as interest, to resort to less convenient\\nchannels for their foreign trade. But the mild voice of reason, pleading\\nthe cause of an enlarged and permanent interest, is but too often\\ndrowned, before public bodies as well as individuals, by the clamors of\\nan impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain.\\n\\nThe necessity of a superintending authority over the reciprocal trade of\\nconfederated States, has been illustrated by other examples as well as\\nour own. In Switzerland, where the Union is so very slight, each canton\\nis obliged to allow to merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction\\ninto other cantons, without an augmentation of the tolls. In Germany it\\nis a law of the empire, that the princes and states shall not lay tolls\\nor customs on bridges, rivers, or passages, without the consent of\\nthe emperor and the diet; though it appears from a quotation in an\\nantecedent paper, that the practice in this, as in many other instances\\nin that confederacy, has not followed the law, and has produced there\\nthe mischiefs which have been foreseen here. Among the restraints\\nimposed by the Union of the Netherlands on its members, one is, that\\nthey shall not establish imposts disadvantageous to their neighbors,\\nwithout the general permission.\\n\\nThe regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is very properly\\nunfettered from two limitations in the articles of Confederation, which\\nrender the provision obscure and contradictory. The power is there\\nrestrained to Indians, not members of any of the States, and is not to\\nviolate or infringe the legislative right of any State within its own\\nlimits. What description of Indians are to be deemed members of a State,\\nis not yet settled, and has been a question of frequent perplexity and\\ncontention in the federal councils. And how the trade with Indians,\\nthough not members of a State, yet residing within its legislative\\njurisdiction, can be regulated by an external authority, without so\\nfar intruding on the internal rights of legislation, is absolutely\\nincomprehensible. This is not the only case in which the articles\\nof Confederation have inconsiderately endeavored to accomplish\\nimpossibilities; to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the Union, with\\ncomplete sovereignty in the States; to subvert a mathematical axiom, by\\ntaking away a part, and letting the whole remain.\\n\\nAll that need be remarked on the power to coin money, regulate the value\\nthereof, and of foreign coin, is, that by providing for this last case,\\nthe Constitution has supplied a material omission in the articles of\\nConfederation. The authority of the existing Congress is restrained to\\nthe regulation of coin STRUCK by their own authority, or that of the\\nrespective States. It must be seen at once that the proposed uniformity\\nin the VALUE of the current coin might be destroyed by subjecting that\\nof foreign coin to the different regulations of the different States.\\n\\nThe punishment of counterfeiting the public securities, as well as\\nthe current coin, is submitted of course to that authority which is to\\nsecure the value of both.\\n\\nThe regulation of weights and measures is transferred from the articles\\nof Confederation, and is founded on like considerations with the\\npreceding power of regulating coin.\\n\\nThe dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been remarked\\nas a fault in our system, and as laying a foundation for intricate and\\ndelicate questions. In the fourth article of the Confederation, it is\\ndeclared \"that the FREE INHABITANTS of each of these States, paupers,\\nvagabonds, and fugitives from justice, excepted, shall be entitled to\\nall privileges and immunities of FREE CITIZENS in the several States;\\nand THE PEOPLE of each State shall, in every other, enjoy all the\\nprivileges of trade and commerce,\" etc. There is a confusion of language\\nhere, which is remarkable. Why the terms FREE INHABITANTS are used\\nin one part of the article, FREE CITIZENS in another, and PEOPLE\\nin another; or what was meant by superadding to \"all privileges\\nand immunities of free citizens,\" \"all the privileges of trade and\\ncommerce,\" cannot easily be determined. It seems to be a construction\\nscarcely avoidable, however, that those who come under the denomination\\nof FREE INHABITANTS of a State, although not citizens of such State, are\\nentitled, in every other State, to all the privileges of FREE CITIZENS\\nof the latter; that is, to greater privileges than they may be entitled\\nto in their own State: so that it may be in the power of a particular\\nState, or rather every State is laid under a necessity, not only to\\nconfer the rights of citizenship in other States upon any whom it may\\nadmit to such rights within itself, but upon any whom it may allow to\\nbecome inhabitants within its jurisdiction. But were an exposition of\\nthe term \"inhabitants\" to be admitted which would confine the stipulated\\nprivileges to citizens alone, the difficulty is diminished only, not\\nremoved. The very improper power would still be retained by each State,\\nof naturalizing aliens in every other State. In one State, residence\\nfor a short term confirms all the rights of citizenship: in another,\\nqualifications of greater importance are required. An alien, therefore,\\nlegally incapacitated for certain rights in the latter, may, by previous\\nresidence only in the former, elude his incapacity; and thus the law of\\none State be preposterously rendered paramount to the law of another,\\nwithin the jurisdiction of the other. We owe it to mere casualty, that\\nvery serious embarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped.\\nBy the laws of several States, certain descriptions of aliens, who had\\nrendered themselves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts inconsistent\\nnot only with the rights of citizenship but with the privilege of\\nresidence. What would have been the consequence, if such persons, by\\nresidence or otherwise, had acquired the character of citizens under the\\nlaws of another State, and then asserted their rights as such, both to\\nresidence and citizenship, within the State proscribing them? Whatever\\nthe legal consequences might have been, other consequences would\\nprobably have resulted, of too serious a nature not to be provided\\nagainst. The new Constitution has accordingly, with great propriety,\\nmade provision against them, and all others proceeding from the defect\\nof the Confederation on this head, by authorizing the general government\\nto establish a uniform rule of naturalization throughout the United\\nStates.\\n\\nThe power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately\\nconnected with the regulation of commerce, and will prevent so many\\nfrauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into\\ndifferent States, that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn\\ninto question.\\n\\nThe power of prescribing by general laws, the manner in which the public\\nacts, records and judicial proceedings of each State shall be proved,\\nand the effect they shall have in other States, is an evident and\\nvaluable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in the\\narticles of Confederation. The meaning of the latter is extremely\\nindeterminate, and can be of little importance under any interpretation\\nwhich it will bear. The power here established may be rendered a very\\nconvenient instrument of justice, and be particularly beneficial on the\\nborders of contiguous States, where the effects liable to justice may be\\nsuddenly and secretly translated, in any stage of the process, within a\\nforeign jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe power of establishing post roads must, in every view, be a harmless\\npower, and may, perhaps, by judicious management, become productive\\nof great public conveniency. Nothing which tends to facilitate the\\nintercourse between the States can be deemed unworthy of the public\\ncare.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 43\\n\\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Powers Conferred by the Constitution\\nFurther Considered)\\n\\nFor the Independent Journal. Wednesday, January 23, 1788\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nTHE FOURTH class comprises the following miscellaneous powers:\\n\\n1. A power \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by\\nsecuring, for a limited time, to authors and inventors, the exclusive\\nright to their respective writings and discoveries.\"\\n\\nThe utility of this power will scarcely be questioned. The copyright of\\nauthors has been solemnly adjudged, in Great Britain, to be a right of\\ncommon law. The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to\\nbelong to the inventors. The public good fully coincides in both cases\\nwith the claims of individuals. The States cannot separately make\\neffectual provisions for either of the cases, and most of them have\\nanticipated the decision of this point, by laws passed at the instance\\nof Congress.\\n\\n2. \"To exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over\\nsuch district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of\\nparticular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the\\ngovernment of the United States; and to exercise like authority over\\nall places purchased by the consent of the legislatures of the States in\\nwhich the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,\\ndockyards, and other needful buildings.\"\\n\\nThe indispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of\\ngovernment, carries its own evidence with it. It is a power exercised by\\nevery legislature of the Union, I might say of the world, by virtue of\\nits general supremacy. Without it, not only the public authority\\nmight be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but\\na dependence of the members of the general government on the State\\ncomprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise\\nof their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe\\nor influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory\\nto the other members of the Confederacy. This consideration has the\\nmore weight, as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the\\nstationary residence of the government would be both too great a public\\npledge to be left in the hands of a single State, and would create\\nso many obstacles to a removal of the government, as still further to\\nabridge its necessary independence. The extent of this federal district\\nis sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy every jealousy of an opposite\\nnature. And as it is to be appropriated to this use with the consent of\\nthe State ceding it; as the State will no doubt provide in the compact\\nfor the rights and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the\\ninhabitants will find sufficient inducements of interest to become\\nwilling parties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the\\nelection of the government which is to exercise authority over them;\\nas a municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own\\nsuffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the authority of the\\nlegislature of the State, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of\\nit, to concur in the cession, will be derived from the whole people\\nof the State in their adoption of the Constitution, every imaginable\\nobjection seems to be obviated.\\n\\nThe necessity of a like authority over forts, magazines, etc.,\\nestablished by the general government, is not less evident. The public\\nmoney expended on such places, and the public property deposited in\\nthem, requires that they should be exempt from the authority of the\\nparticular State. Nor would it be proper for the places on which the\\nsecurity of the entire Union may depend, to be in any degree dependent\\non a particular member of it. All objections and scruples are here also\\nobviated, by requiring the concurrence of the States concerned, in every\\nsuch establishment.\\n\\n3. \"To declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason\\nshall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of\\nthe person attained.\"\\n\\nAs treason may be committed against the United States, the authority of\\nthe United States ought to be enabled to punish it. But as new-fangled\\nand artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent\\nfactions, the natural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked\\ntheir alternate malignity on each other, the convention have, with great\\njudgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a\\nconstitutional definition of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for\\nconviction of it, and restraining the Congress, even in punishing\\nit, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of its\\nauthor.\\n\\n4. \"To admit new States into the Union; but no new State shall be formed\\nor erected within the jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State\\nbe formed by the junction of two or more States, or parts of States,\\nwithout the consent of the legislatures of the States concerned, as well\\nas of the Congress.\"\\n\\nIn the articles of Confederation, no provision is found on this\\nimportant subject. Canada was to be admitted of right, on her joining in\\nthe measures of the United States; and the other COLONIES, by which were\\nevidently meant the other British colonies, at the discretion of nine\\nStates. The eventual establishment of NEW STATES seems to have been\\noverlooked by the compilers of that instrument. We have seen the\\ninconvenience of this omission, and the assumption of power into which\\nCongress have been led by it. With great propriety, therefore, has the\\nnew system supplied the defect. The general precaution, that no\\nnew States shall be formed, without the concurrence of the federal\\nauthority, and that of the States concerned, is consonant to the\\nprinciples which ought to govern such transactions. The particular\\nprecaution against the erection of new States, by the partition of a\\nState without its consent, quiets the jealousy of the larger States; as\\nthat of the smaller is quieted by a like precaution, against a junction\\nof States without their consent.\\n\\n5. \"To dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting\\nthe territory or other property belonging to the United States,\" with a\\nproviso, that \"nothing in the Constitution shall be so construed as to\\nprejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular State.\"\\n\\nThis is a power of very great importance, and required by considerations\\nsimilar to those which show the propriety of the former. The proviso\\nannexed is proper in itself, and was probably rendered absolutely\\nnecessary by jealousies and questions concerning the Western territory\\nsufficiently known to the public.\\n\\n6. \"To guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of\\ngovernment; to protect each of them against invasion; and on application\\nof the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be\\nconvened), against domestic violence.\"\\n\\nIn a confederacy founded on republican principles, and composed of\\nrepublican members, the superintending government ought clearly\\nto possess authority to defend the system against aristocratic or\\nmonarchial innovations. The more intimate the nature of such a union may\\nbe, the greater interest have the members in the political institutions\\nof each other; and the greater right to insist that the forms\\nof government under which the compact was entered into should be\\nSUBSTANTIALLY maintained. But a right implies a remedy; and where\\nelse could the remedy be deposited, than where it is deposited by the\\nConstitution? Governments of dissimilar principles and forms have been\\nfound less adapted to a federal coalition of any sort, than those of\\na kindred nature. \"As the confederate republic of Germany,\" says\\nMontesquieu, \"consists of free cities and petty states, subject to\\ndifferent princes, experience shows us that it is more imperfect than\\nthat of Holland and Switzerland.\" \"Greece was undone,\" he adds, \"as soon\\nas the king of Macedon obtained a seat among the Amphictyons.\" In\\nthe latter case, no doubt, the disproportionate force, as well as the\\nmonarchical form, of the new confederate, had its share of influence on\\nthe events. It may possibly be asked, what need there could be of such\\na precaution, and whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in\\nthe State governments, without the concurrence of the States themselves.\\nThese questions admit of ready answers. If the interposition of the\\ngeneral government should not be needed, the provision for such an event\\nwill be a harmless superfluity only in the Constitution. But who can say\\nwhat experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular States, by\\nthe ambition of enterprising leaders, or by the intrigues and influence\\nof foreign powers? To the second question it may be answered, that if\\nthe general government should interpose by virtue of this constitutional\\nauthority, it will be, of course, bound to pursue the authority. But the\\nauthority extends no further than to a GUARANTY of a republican form of\\ngovernment, which supposes a pre-existing government of the form which\\nis to be guaranteed. As long, therefore, as the existing republican\\nforms are continued by the States, they are guaranteed by the federal\\nConstitution. Whenever the States may choose to substitute other\\nrepublican forms, they have a right to do so, and to claim the federal\\nguaranty for the latter. The only restriction imposed on them is, that\\nthey shall not exchange republican for antirepublican Constitutions;\\na restriction which, it is presumed, will hardly be considered as a\\ngrievance.\\n\\nA protection against invasion is due from every society to the parts\\ncomposing it. The latitude of the expression here used seems to secure\\neach State, not only against foreign hostility, but against ambitious or\\nvindictive enterprises of its more powerful neighbors. The history, both\\nof ancient and modern confederacies, proves that the weaker members of\\nthe union ought not to be insensible to the policy of this article.\\n\\nProtection against domestic violence is added with equal propriety. It\\nhas been remarked, that even among the Swiss cantons, which, properly\\nspeaking, are not under one government, provision is made for this\\nobject; and the history of that league informs us that mutual aid is\\nfrequently claimed and afforded; and as well by the most democratic,\\nas the other cantons. A recent and well-known event among ourselves has\\nwarned us to be prepared for emergencies of a like nature.\\n\\nAt first view, it might seem not to square with the republican theory,\\nto suppose, either that a majority have not the right, or that a\\nminority will have the force, to subvert a government; and consequently,\\nthat the federal interposition can never be required, but when it would\\nbe improper. But theoretic reasoning, in this as in most other cases,\\nmust be qualified by the lessons of practice. Why may not illicit\\ncombinations, for purposes of violence, be formed as well by a majority\\nof a State, especially a small State as by a majority of a county, or a\\ndistrict of the same State; and if the authority of the State ought, in\\nthe latter case, to protect the local magistracy, ought not the federal\\nauthority, in the former, to support the State authority? Besides, there\\nare certain parts of the State constitutions which are so interwoven\\nwith the federal Constitution, that a violent blow cannot be given to\\nthe one without communicating the wound to the other. Insurrections in\\na State will rarely induce a federal interposition, unless the number\\nconcerned in them bear some proportion to the friends of government. It\\nwill be much better that the violence in such cases should be repressed\\nby the superintending power, than that the majority should be left to\\nmaintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest. The existence of\\na right to interpose, will generally prevent the necessity of exerting\\nit.\\n\\nIs it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side\\nin republican governments? May not the minor party possess such a\\nsuperiority of pecuniary resources, of military talents and experience,\\nor of secret succors from foreign powers, as will render it superior\\nalso in an appeal to the sword? May not a more compact and advantageous\\nposition turn the scale on the same side, against a superior number so\\nsituated as to be less capable of a prompt and collected exertion of its\\nstrength? Nothing can be more chimerical than to imagine that in a trial\\nof actual force, victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail\\nin a census of the inhabitants, or which determine the event of an\\nelection! May it not happen, in fine, that the minority of CITIZENS may\\nbecome a majority of PERSONS, by the accession of alien residents, of\\na casual concourse of adventurers, or of those whom the constitution of\\nthe State has not admitted to the rights of suffrage? I take no notice\\nof an unhappy species of population abounding in some of the States,\\nwho, during the calm of regular government, are sunk below the level of\\nmen; but who, in the tempestuous scenes of civil violence, may emerge\\ninto the human character, and give a superiority of strength to any\\nparty with which they may associate themselves.\\n\\nIn cases where it may be doubtful on which side justice lies, what\\nbetter umpires could be desired by two violent factions, flying to arms,\\nand tearing a State to pieces, than the representatives of confederate\\nStates, not heated by the local flame? To the impartiality of judges,\\nthey would unite the affection of friends. Happy would it be if such a\\nremedy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free governments; if\\na project equally effectual could be established for the universal peace\\nof mankind!\\n\\nShould it be asked, what is to be the redress for an insurrection\\npervading all the States, and comprising a superiority of the entire\\nforce, though not a constitutional right? the answer must be, that such\\na case, as it would be without the compass of human remedies, so it is\\nfortunately not within the compass of human probability; and that it\\nis a sufficient recommendation of the federal Constitution, that it\\ndiminishes the risk of a calamity for which no possible constitution can\\nprovide a cure.\\n\\nAmong the advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by\\nMontesquieu, an important one is, \"that should a popular insurrection\\nhappen in one of the States, the others are able to quell it. Should\\nabuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain\\nsound.\"\\n\\n7. \"To consider all debts contracted, and engagements entered into,\\nbefore the adoption of this Constitution, as being no less valid\\nagainst the United States, under this Constitution, than under the\\nConfederation.\"\\n\\nThis can only be considered as a declaratory proposition; and may have\\nbeen inserted, among other reasons, for the satisfaction of the foreign\\ncreditors of the United States, who cannot be strangers to the pretended\\ndoctrine, that a change in the political form of civil society has the\\nmagical effect of dissolving its moral obligations.\\n\\nAmong the lesser criticisms which have been exercised on the\\nConstitution, it has been remarked that the validity of engagements\\nought to have been asserted in favor of the United States, as well\\nas against them; and in the spirit which usually characterizes little\\ncritics, the omission has been transformed and magnified into a plot\\nagainst the national rights. The authors of this discovery may be told,\\nwhat few others need to be informed of, that as engagements are in\\ntheir nature reciprocal, an assertion of their validity on one side,\\nnecessarily involves a validity on the other side; and that as the\\narticle is merely declaratory, the establishment of the principle in one\\ncase is sufficient for every case. They may be further told, that\\nevery constitution must limit its precautions to dangers that are\\nnot altogether imaginary; and that no real danger can exist that the\\ngovernment would DARE, with, or even without, this constitutional\\ndeclaration before it, to remit the debts justly due to the public, on\\nthe pretext here condemned.\\n\\n8. \"To provide for amendments to be ratified by three fourths of the\\nStates under two exceptions only.\"\\n\\nThat useful alterations will be suggested by experience, could not but\\nbe foreseen. It was requisite, therefore, that a mode for introducing\\nthem should be provided. The mode preferred by the convention seems to\\nbe stamped with every mark of propriety. It guards equally against that\\nextreme facility, which would render the Constitution too mutable; and\\nthat extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its discovered faults.\\nIt, moreover, equally enables the general and the State governments to\\noriginate the amendment of errors, as they may be pointed out by the\\nexperience on one side, or on the other. The exception in favor of the\\nequality of suffrage in the Senate, was probably meant as a palladium\\nto the residuary sovereignty of the States, implied and secured by that\\nprinciple of representation in one branch of the legislature; and\\nwas probably insisted on by the States particularly attached to that\\nequality. The other exception must have been admitted on the same\\nconsiderations which produced the privilege defended by it.\\n\\n9. \"The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be\\nsufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the\\nStates, ratifying the same.\"\\n\\nThis article speaks for itself. The express authority of the people\\nalone could give due validity to the Constitution. To have required the\\nunanimous ratification of the thirteen States, would have subjected\\nthe essential interests of the whole to the caprice or corruption of\\na single member. It would have marked a want of foresight in the\\nconvention, which our own experience would have rendered inexcusable.\\n\\nTwo questions of a very delicate nature present themselves on this\\noccasion: 1. On what principle the Confederation, which stands in the\\nsolemn form of a compact among the States, can be superseded without the\\nunanimous consent of the parties to it? 2. What relation is to subsist\\nbetween the nine or more States ratifying the Constitution, and the\\nremaining few who do not become parties to it?\\n\\nThe first question is answered at once by recurring to the absolute\\nnecessity of the case; to the great principle of self-preservation; to\\nthe transcendent law of nature and of nature\\'s God, which declares\\nthat the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all\\npolitical institutions aim, and to which all such institutions must\\nbe sacrificed. PERHAPS, also, an answer may be found without searching\\nbeyond the principles of the compact itself. It has been heretofore\\nnoted among the defects of the Confederation, that in many of the States\\nit had received no higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification.\\nThe principle of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation\\non the other States should be reduced to the same standard. A compact\\nbetween independent sovereigns, founded on ordinary acts of legislative\\nauthority, can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty\\nbetween the parties. It is an established doctrine on the subject of\\ntreaties, that all the articles are mutually conditions of each other;\\nthat a breach of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty; and\\nthat a breach, committed by either of the parties, absolves the others,\\nand authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact violated\\nand void. Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate\\ntruths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular\\nStates to a dissolution of the federal pact, will not the complaining\\nparties find it a difficult task to answer the MULTIPLIED and IMPORTANT\\ninfractions with which they may be confronted? The time has been when it\\nwas incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits.\\nThe scene is now changed, and with it the part which the same motives\\ndictate.\\n\\nThe second question is not less delicate; and the flattering prospect of\\nits being merely hypothetical forbids an overcurious discussion of it.\\nIt is one of those cases which must be left to provide for itself. In\\ngeneral, it may be observed, that although no political relation can\\nsubsist between the assenting and dissenting States, yet the moral\\nrelations will remain uncancelled. The claims of justice, both on one\\nside and on the other, will be in force, and must be fulfilled; the\\nrights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually respected;\\nwhilst considerations of a common interest, and, above all, the\\nremembrance of the endearing scenes which are past, and the anticipation\\nof a speedy triumph over the obstacles to reunion, will, it is hoped,\\nnot urge in vain MODERATION on one side, and PRUDENCE on the other.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 44\\n\\nRestrictions on the Authority of the Several States\\n\\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, January 25, 1788.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nA FIFTH class of provisions in favor of the federal authority consists\\nof the following restrictions on the authority of the several States:\\n\\n1. \"No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;\\ngrant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit;\\nmake any thing but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts;\\npass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the\\nobligation of contracts; or grant any title of nobility.\"\\n\\nThe prohibition against treaties, alliances, and confederations makes\\na part of the existing articles of Union; and for reasons which need\\nno explanation, is copied into the new Constitution. The prohibition\\nof letters of marque is another part of the old system, but is somewhat\\nextended in the new. According to the former, letters of marque could\\nbe granted by the States after a declaration of war; according to the\\nlatter, these licenses must be obtained, as well during war as previous\\nto its declaration, from the government of the United States. This\\nalteration is fully justified by the advantage of uniformity in all\\npoints which relate to foreign powers; and of immediate responsibility\\nto the nation in all those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be\\nresponsible.\\n\\nThe right of coining money, which is here taken from the States, was\\nleft in their hands by the Confederation, as a concurrent right with\\nthat of Congress, under an exception in favor of the exclusive right of\\nCongress to regulate the alloy and value. In this instance, also, the\\nnew provision is an improvement on the old. Whilst the alloy and value\\ndepended on the general authority, a right of coinage in the particular\\nStates could have no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and\\ndiversify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces. The latter\\ninconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was originally\\nsubmitted to the federal head; and as far as the former might prevent\\nan inconvenient remittance of gold and silver to the central mint for\\nrecoinage, the end can be as well attained by local mints established\\nunder the general authority.\\n\\nThe extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure\\nto every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge\\nof the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has\\nsustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money\\non the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary\\nconfidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the\\npeople, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an\\nenormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure,\\nwhich must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt,\\nwhich can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the\\naltar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it. In\\naddition to these persuasive considerations, it may be observed, that\\nthe same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the\\npower of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not\\nto be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had\\nevery State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as\\nmany different currencies as States, and thus the intercourse among them\\nwould be impeded; retrospective alterations in its value might be made,\\nand thus the citizens of other States be injured, and animosities be\\nkindled among the States themselves. The subjects of foreign powers\\nmight suffer from the same cause, and hence the Union be discredited\\nand embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member. No one of these\\nmischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper money,\\nthan to coin gold or silver. The power to make any thing but gold and\\nsilver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the States, on\\nthe same principle with that of issuing a paper currency.\\n\\nBills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and laws impairing the\\nobligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the\\nsocial compact, and to every principle of sound legislation. The two\\nformer are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of\\nthe State constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit\\nand scope of these fundamental charters. Our own experience has taught\\nus, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought not\\nto be omitted. Very properly, therefore, have the convention added this\\nconstitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights;\\nand I am much deceived if they have not, in so doing, as faithfully\\nconsulted the genuine sentiments as the undoubted interests of their\\nconstituents. The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating\\npolicy which has directed the public councils. They have seen\\nwith regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative\\ninterferences, in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the\\nhands of enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the\\nmore-industrious and less-informed part of the community. They have seen,\\ntoo, that one legislative interference is but the first link of a long\\nchain of repetitions, every subsequent interference being naturally\\nproduced by the effects of the preceding. They very rightly infer,\\ntherefore, that some thorough reform is wanting, which will banish\\nspeculations on public measures, inspire a general prudence and\\nindustry, and give a regular course to the business of society. The\\nprohibition with respect to titles of nobility is copied from the\\narticles of Confederation and needs no comment.\\n\\n2. \"No State shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts\\nor duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary\\nfor executing its inspection laws, and the net produce of all duties and\\nimposts laid by any State on imports or exports, shall be for the use of\\nthe treasury of the United States; and all such laws shall be subject\\nto the revision and control of the Congress. No State shall, without the\\nconsent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage, keep troops or ships of\\nwar in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another\\nState, or with a foreign power, or engage in war unless actually\\ninvaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.\"\\n\\nThe restraint on the power of the States over imports and exports is\\nenforced by all the arguments which prove the necessity of submitting\\nthe regulation of trade to the federal councils. It is needless,\\ntherefore, to remark further on this head, than that the manner in which\\nthe restraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to\\nthe States a reasonable discretion in providing for the conveniency of\\ntheir imports and exports, and to the United States a reasonable check\\nagainst the abuse of this discretion. The remaining particulars of this\\nclause fall within reasonings which are either so obvious, or have been\\nso fully developed, that they may be passed over without remark.\\n\\nThe SIXTH and last class consists of the several powers and provisions\\nby which efficacy is given to all the rest.\\n\\n1. Of these the first is, the \"power to make all laws which shall be\\nnecessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers,\\nand all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of\\nthe United States, or in any department or officer thereof.\"\\n\\nFew parts of the Constitution have been assailed with more intemperance\\nthan this; yet on a fair investigation of it, no part can appear more\\ncompletely invulnerable. Without the SUBSTANCE of this power, the whole\\nConstitution would be a dead letter. Those who object to the article,\\ntherefore, as a part of the Constitution, can only mean that the FORM\\nof the provision is improper. But have they considered whether a better\\nform could have been substituted?\\n\\nThere are four other possible methods which the Constitution might have\\ntaken on this subject. They might have copied the second article of the\\nexisting Confederation, which would have prohibited the exercise of\\nany power not EXPRESSLY delegated; they might have attempted a\\npositive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms\\n\"necessary and proper\"; they might have attempted a negative enumeration\\nof them, by specifying the powers excepted from the general definition;\\nthey might have been altogether silent on the subject, leaving these\\nnecessary and proper powers to construction and inference.\\n\\nHad the convention taken the first method of adopting the second\\narticle of Confederation, it is evident that the new Congress would be\\ncontinually exposed, as their predecessors have been, to the alternative\\nof construing the term \"EXPRESSLY\" with so much rigor, as to disarm the\\ngovernment of all real authority whatever, or with so much latitude as\\nto destroy altogether the force of the restriction. It would be easy to\\nshow, if it were necessary, that no important power, delegated by the\\narticles of Confederation, has been or can be executed by Congress,\\nwithout recurring more or less to the doctrine of CONSTRUCTION or\\nIMPLICATION. As the powers delegated under the new system are more\\nextensive, the government which is to administer it would find itself\\nstill more distressed with the alternative of betraying the public\\ninterests by doing nothing, or of violating the Constitution by\\nexercising powers indispensably necessary and proper, but, at the same\\ntime, not EXPRESSLY granted.\\n\\nHad the convention attempted a positive enumeration of the powers\\nnecessary and proper for carrying their other powers into effect, the\\nattempt would have involved a complete digest of laws on every subject\\nto which the Constitution relates; accommodated too, not only to the\\nexisting state of things, but to all the possible changes which futurity\\nmay produce; for in every new application of a general power, the\\nPARTICULAR POWERS, which are the means of attaining the OBJECT of the\\ngeneral power, must always necessarily vary with that object, and be\\noften properly varied whilst the object remains the same.\\n\\nHad they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means not\\nnecessary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution, the\\ntask would have been no less chimerical; and would have been liable to\\nthis further objection, that every defect in the enumeration would have\\nbeen equivalent to a positive grant of authority. If, to avoid this\\nconsequence, they had attempted a partial enumeration of the exceptions,\\nand described the residue by the general terms, NOT NECESSARY OR PROPER,\\nit must have happened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the\\nexcepted powers only; that these would be such as would be least likely\\nto be assumed or tolerated, because the enumeration would of course\\nselect such as would be least necessary or proper; and that the\\nunnecessary and improper powers included in the residuum, would be less\\nforcibly excepted, than if no partial enumeration had been made.\\n\\nHad the Constitution been silent on this head, there can be no doubt\\nthat all the particular powers requisite as means of executing the\\ngeneral powers would have resulted to the government, by unavoidable\\nimplication. No axiom is more clearly established in law, or in reason,\\nthan that wherever the end is required, the means are authorized;\\nwherever a general power to do a thing is given, every particular power\\nnecessary for doing it is included. Had this last method, therefore,\\nbeen pursued by the convention, every objection now urged against their\\nplan would remain in all its plausibility; and the real inconveniency\\nwould be incurred of not removing a pretext which may be seized on\\ncritical occasions for drawing into question the essential powers of the\\nUnion.\\n\\nIf it be asked what is to be the consequence, in case the Congress\\nshall misconstrue this part of the Constitution, and exercise powers\\nnot warranted by its true meaning, I answer, the same as if they should\\nmisconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them; as if the general\\npower had been reduced to particulars, and any one of these were to\\nbe violated; the same, in short, as if the State legislatures should\\nviolate the irrespective constitutional authorities. In the first\\ninstance, the success of the usurpation will depend on the executive\\nand judiciary departments, which are to expound and give effect to the\\nlegislative acts; and in the last resort a remedy must be obtained from\\nthe people who can, by the election of more faithful representatives,\\nannul the acts of the usurpers. The truth is, that this ultimate redress\\nmay be more confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal\\nthan of the State legislatures, for this plain reason, that as every\\nsuch act of the former will be an invasion of the rights of the latter,\\nthese will be ever ready to mark the innovation, to sound the alarm to\\nthe people, and to exert their local influence in effecting a change of\\nfederal representatives. There being no such intermediate body between\\nthe State legislatures and the people interested in watching the conduct\\nof the former, violations of the State constitutions are more likely to\\nremain unnoticed and unredressed.\\n\\n2. \"This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall\\nbe made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be\\nmade, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law\\nof the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby,\\nany thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\\nnotwithstanding.\"\\n\\nThe indiscreet zeal of the adversaries to the Constitution has betrayed\\nthem into an attack on this part of it also, without which it would have\\nbeen evidently and radically defective. To be fully sensible of this,\\nwe need only suppose for a moment that the supremacy of the State\\nconstitutions had been left complete by a saving clause in their favor.\\n\\nIn the first place, as these constitutions invest the State legislatures\\nwith absolute sovereignty, in all cases not excepted by the existing\\narticles of Confederation, all the authorities contained in the\\nproposed Constitution, so far as they exceed those enumerated in the\\nConfederation, would have been annulled, and the new Congress would have\\nbeen reduced to the same impotent condition with their predecessors.\\n\\nIn the next place, as the constitutions of some of the States do\\nnot even expressly and fully recognize the existing powers of the\\nConfederacy, an express saving of the supremacy of the former would,\\nin such States, have brought into question every power contained in the\\nproposed Constitution.\\n\\nIn the third place, as the constitutions of the States differ much from\\neach other, it might happen that a treaty or national law, of great and\\nequal importance to the States, would interfere with some and not with\\nother constitutions, and would consequently be valid in some of the\\nStates, at the same time that it would have no effect in others.\\n\\nIn fine, the world would have seen, for the first time, a system of\\ngovernment founded on an inversion of the fundamental principles of all\\ngovernment; it would have seen the authority of the whole society every\\nwhere subordinate to the authority of the parts; it would have seen a\\nmonster, in which the head was under the direction of the members.\\n\\n3. \"The Senators and Representatives, and the members of the several\\nState legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of\\nthe United States and the several States, shall be bound by oath or\\naffirmation to support this Constitution.\"\\n\\nIt has been asked why it was thought necessary, that the State\\nmagistracy should be bound to support the federal Constitution, and\\nunnecessary that a like oath should be imposed on the officers of the\\nUnited States, in favor of the State constitutions.\\n\\nSeveral reasons might be assigned for the distinction. I content myself\\nwith one, which is obvious and conclusive. The members of the federal\\ngovernment will have no agency in carrying the State constitutions\\ninto effect. The members and officers of the State governments, on the\\ncontrary, will have an essential agency in giving effect to the federal\\nConstitution. The election of the President and Senate will depend, in\\nall cases, on the legislatures of the several States. And the election\\nof the House of Representatives will equally depend on the same\\nauthority in the first instance; and will, probably, forever be\\nconducted by the officers, and according to the laws, of the States.\\n\\n4. Among the provisions for giving efficacy to the federal powers might\\nbe added those which belong to the executive and judiciary departments:\\nbut as these are reserved for particular examination in another place, I\\npass them over in this.\\n\\nWe have now reviewed, in detail, all the articles composing the sum or\\nquantity of power delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal\\ngovernment, and are brought to this undeniable conclusion, that no part\\nof the power is unnecessary or improper for accomplishing the necessary\\nobjects of the Union. The question, therefore, whether this amount of\\npower shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question,\\nwhether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union\\nshall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall\\nbe preserved.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 45\\n\\nThe Alleged Danger From the Powers of the Union to the State Governments.\\n\\nConsidered For the Independent Journal. Saturday, January 26, 1788\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nHAVING shown that no one of the powers transferred to the federal\\ngovernment is unnecessary or improper, the next question to be\\nconsidered is, whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous to the\\nportion of authority left in the several States.\\n\\nThe adversaries to the plan of the convention, instead of considering\\nin the first place what degree of power was absolutely necessary for\\nthe purposes of the federal government, have exhausted themselves in a\\nsecondary inquiry into the possible consequences of the proposed degree\\nof power to the governments of the particular States. But if the Union,\\nas has been shown, be essential to the security of the people of America\\nagainst foreign danger; if it be essential to their security against\\ncontentions and wars among the different States; if it be essential to\\nguard them against those violent and oppressive factions which embitter\\nthe blessings of liberty, and against those military establishments\\nwhich must gradually poison its very fountain; if, in a word, the\\nUnion be essential to the happiness of the people of America, is it not\\npreposterous, to urge as an objection to a government, without which\\nthe objects of the Union cannot be attained, that such a government\\nmay derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual\\nStates? Was, then, the American Revolution effected, was the American\\nConfederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands spilt, and\\nthe hard-earned substance of millions lavished, not that the people of\\nAmerica should enjoy peace, liberty, and safety, but that the government\\nof the individual States, that particular municipal establishments,\\nmight enjoy a certain extent of power, and be arrayed with certain\\ndignities and attributes of sovereignty? We have heard of the impious\\ndoctrine in the Old World, that the people were made for kings, not\\nkings for the people. Is the same doctrine to be revived in the New, in\\nanother shape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed\\nto the views of political institutions of a different form? It is too\\nearly for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good,\\nthe real welfare of the great body of the people, is the supreme object\\nto be pursued; and that no form of government whatever has any other\\nvalue than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object. Were\\nthe plan of the convention adverse to the public happiness, my voice\\nwould be, Reject the plan. Were the Union itself inconsistent with the\\npublic happiness, it would be, Abolish the Union. In like manner, as far\\nas the sovereignty of the States cannot be reconciled to the happiness\\nof the people, the voice of every good citizen must be, Let the former\\nbe sacrificed to the latter. How far the sacrifice is necessary, has\\nbeen shown. How far the unsacrificed residue will be endangered, is the\\nquestion before us.\\n\\nSeveral important considerations have been touched in the course of\\nthese papers, which discountenance the supposition that the operation\\nof the federal government will by degrees prove fatal to the State\\ngovernments. The more I revolve the subject, the more fully I am\\npersuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by the\\npreponderancy of the last than of the first scale.\\n\\nWe have seen, in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies,\\nthe strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the members,\\nto despoil the general government of its authorities, with a very\\nineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself against the\\nencroachments. Although, in most of these examples, the system has been\\nso dissimilar from that under consideration as greatly to weaken any\\ninference concerning the latter from the fate of the former, yet, as the\\nStates will retain, under the proposed Constitution, a very extensive\\nportion of active sovereignty, the inference ought not to be wholly\\ndisregarded. In the Achaean league it is probable that the federal head\\nhad a degree and species of power, which gave it a considerable likeness\\nto the government framed by the convention. The Lycian Confederacy, as\\nfar as its principles and form are transmitted, must have borne a still\\ngreater analogy to it. Yet history does not inform us that either of\\nthem ever degenerated, or tended to degenerate, into one consolidated\\ngovernment. On the contrary, we know that the ruin of one of them\\nproceeded from the incapacity of the federal authority to prevent the\\ndissensions, and finally the disunion, of the subordinate authorities.\\nThese cases are the more worthy of our attention, as the external\\ncauses by which the component parts were pressed together were much more\\nnumerous and powerful than in our case; and consequently less powerful\\nligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members to the head,\\nand to each other.\\n\\nIn the feudal system, we have seen a similar propensity exemplified.\\nNotwithstanding the want of proper sympathy in every instance between\\nthe local sovereigns and the people, and the sympathy in some instances\\nbetween the general sovereign and the latter, it usually happened that\\nthe local sovereigns prevailed in the rivalship for encroachments. Had\\nno external dangers enforced internal harmony and subordination, and\\nparticularly, had the local sovereigns possessed the affections of the\\npeople, the great kingdoms in Europe would at this time consist of as\\nmany independent princes as there were formerly feudatory barons.\\n\\nThe State governments will have the advantage of the Federal government,\\nwhether we compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the\\none on the other; to the weight of personal influence which each\\nside will possess; to the powers respectively vested in them; to the\\npredilection and probable support of the people; to the disposition and\\nfaculty of resisting and frustrating the measures of each other.\\n\\nThe State governments may be regarded as constituent and essential parts\\nof the federal government; whilst the latter is nowise essential to the\\noperation or organization of the former. Without the intervention of the\\nState legislatures, the President of the United States cannot be elected\\nat all. They must in all cases have a great share in his appointment,\\nand will, perhaps, in most cases, of themselves determine it. The Senate\\nwill be elected absolutely and exclusively by the State legislatures.\\nEven the House of Representatives, though drawn immediately from the\\npeople, will be chosen very much under the influence of that class of\\nmen, whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an election\\ninto the State legislatures. Thus, each of the principal branches of the\\nfederal government will owe its existence more or less to the favor of\\nthe State governments, and must consequently feel a dependence, which\\nis much more likely to beget a disposition too obsequious than too\\noverbearing towards them. On the other side, the component parts of the\\nState governments will in no instance be indebted for their appointment\\nto the direct agency of the federal government, and very little, if at\\nall, to the local influence of its members.\\n\\nThe number of individuals employed under the Constitution of the\\nUnited States will be much smaller than the number employed under the\\nparticular States. There will consequently be less of personal influence\\non the side of the former than of the latter. The members of the\\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary departments of thirteen and more\\nStates, the justices of peace, officers of militia, ministerial officers\\nof justice, with all the county, corporation, and town officers, for\\nthree millions and more of people, intermixed, and having particular\\nacquaintance with every class and circle of people, must exceed, beyond\\nall proportion, both in number and influence, those of every description\\nwho will be employed in the administration of the federal system.\\nCompare the members of the three great departments of the thirteen\\nStates, excluding from the judiciary department the justices of\\npeace, with the members of the corresponding departments of the single\\ngovernment of the Union; compare the militia officers of three millions\\nof people with the military and marine officers of any establishment\\nwhich is within the compass of probability, or, I may add, of\\npossibility, and in this view alone, we may pronounce the advantage\\nof the States to be decisive. If the federal government is to have\\ncollectors of revenue, the State governments will have theirs also. And\\nas those of the former will be principally on the seacoast, and not very\\nnumerous, whilst those of the latter will be spread over the face of the\\ncountry, and will be very numerous, the advantage in this view also lies\\non the same side. It is true, that the Confederacy is to possess, and\\nmay exercise, the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes\\nthroughout the States; but it is probable that this power will not be\\nresorted to, except for supplemental purposes of revenue; that an option\\nwill then be given to the States to supply their quotas by previous\\ncollections of their own; and that the eventual collection, under\\nthe immediate authority of the Union, will generally be made by the\\nofficers, and according to the rules, appointed by the several States.\\nIndeed it is extremely probable, that in other instances, particularly\\nin the organization of the judicial power, the officers of the States\\nwill be clothed with the correspondent authority of the Union. Should it\\nhappen, however, that separate collectors of internal revenue should\\nbe appointed under the federal government, the influence of the whole\\nnumber would not bear a comparison with that of the multitude of State\\nofficers in the opposite scale. Within every district to which a federal\\ncollector would be allotted, there would not be less than thirty or\\nforty, or even more, officers of different descriptions, and many of\\nthem persons of character and weight, whose influence would lie on the\\nside of the State.\\n\\nThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal\\ngovernment, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State\\ngovernments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised\\nprincipally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign\\ncommerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part,\\nbe connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to\\nall the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the\\nlives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order,\\nimprovement, and prosperity of the State.\\n\\nThe operations of the federal government will be most extensive and\\nimportant in times of war and danger; those of the State governments, in\\ntimes of peace and security. As the former periods will probably bear\\na small proportion to the latter, the State governments will here\\nenjoy another advantage over the federal government. The more adequate,\\nindeed, the federal powers may be rendered to the national defense, the\\nless frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their\\nascendancy over the governments of the particular States.\\n\\nIf the new Constitution be examined with accuracy and candor, it will\\nbe found that the change which it proposes consists much less in the\\naddition of NEW POWERS to the Union, than in the invigoration of its\\nORIGINAL POWERS. The regulation of commerce, it is true, is a new power;\\nbut that seems to be an addition which few oppose, and from which no\\napprehensions are entertained. The powers relating to war and\\npeace, armies and fleets, treaties and finance, with the other more\\nconsiderable powers, are all vested in the existing Congress by the\\narticles of Confederation. The proposed change does not enlarge these\\npowers; it only substitutes a more effectual mode of administering them.\\nThe change relating to taxation may be regarded as the most important;\\nand yet the present Congress have as complete authority to REQUIRE\\nof the States indefinite supplies of money for the common defense and\\ngeneral welfare, as the future Congress will have to require them of\\nindividual citizens; and the latter will be no more bound than the\\nStates themselves have been, to pay the quotas respectively taxed\\non them. Had the States complied punctually with the articles of\\nConfederation, or could their compliance have been enforced by as\\npeaceable means as may be used with success towards single persons,\\nour past experience is very far from countenancing an opinion, that the\\nState governments would have lost their constitutional powers, and have\\ngradually undergone an entire consolidation. To maintain that such an\\nevent would have ensued, would be to say at once, that the existence\\nof the State governments is incompatible with any system whatever that\\naccomplishes the essential purposes of the Union.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 46\\n\\nThe Influence of the State and Federal Governments Compared\\n\\nFrom the New York Packet. Tuesday, January 29, 1788.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nRESUMING the subject of the last paper, I proceed to inquire whether the\\nfederal government or the State governments will have the advantage with\\nregard to the predilection and support of the people. Notwithstanding\\nthe different modes in which they are appointed, we must consider both\\nof them as substantially dependent on the great body of the citizens of\\nthe United States. I assume this position here as it respects the\\nfirst, reserving the proofs for another place. The federal and State\\ngovernments are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people,\\nconstituted with different powers, and designed for different purposes.\\nThe adversaries of the Constitution seem to have lost sight of the\\npeople altogether in their reasonings on this subject; and to have\\nviewed these different establishments, not only as mutual rivals and\\nenemies, but as uncontrolled by any common superior in their efforts\\nto usurp the authorities of each other. These gentlemen must here be\\nreminded of their error. They must be told that the ultimate authority,\\nwherever the derivative may be found, resides in the people alone, and\\nthat it will not depend merely on the comparative ambition or address\\nof the different governments, whether either, or which of them, will be\\nable to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expense of the other.\\nTruth, no less than decency, requires that the event in every case\\nshould be supposed to depend on the sentiments and sanction of their\\ncommon constituents.\\n\\nMany considerations, besides those suggested on a former occasion, seem\\nto place it beyond doubt that the first and most natural attachment of\\nthe people will be to the governments of their respective States. Into\\nthe administration of these a greater number of individuals will\\nexpect to rise. From the gift of these a greater number of offices and\\nemoluments will flow. By the superintending care of these, all the more\\ndomestic and personal interests of the people will be regulated and\\nprovided for. With the affairs of these, the people will be more\\nfamiliarly and minutely conversant. And with the members of these,\\nwill a greater proportion of the people have the ties of personal\\nacquaintance and friendship, and of family and party attachments; on\\nthe side of these, therefore, the popular bias may well be expected most\\nstrongly to incline.\\n\\nExperience speaks the same language in this case. The federal\\nadministration, though hitherto very defective in comparison with\\nwhat may be hoped under a better system, had, during the war, and\\nparticularly whilst the independent fund of paper emissions was in\\ncredit, an activity and importance as great as it can well have in\\nany future circumstances whatever. It was engaged, too, in a course of\\nmeasures which had for their object the protection of everything that\\nwas dear, and the acquisition of everything that could be desirable to\\nthe people at large. It was, nevertheless, invariably found, after\\nthe transient enthusiasm for the early Congresses was over, that the\\nattention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their own\\nparticular governments; that the federal council was at no time the idol\\nof popular favor; and that opposition to proposed enlargements of its\\npowers and importance was the side usually taken by the men who wished\\nto build their political consequence on the prepossessions of their\\nfellow-citizens.\\n\\nIf, therefore, as has been elsewhere remarked, the people should in\\nfuture become more partial to the federal than to the State governments,\\nthe change can only result from such manifest and irresistible proofs\\nof a better administration, as will overcome all their antecedent\\npropensities. And in that case, the people ought not surely to be\\nprecluded from giving most of their confidence where they may discover\\nit to be most due; but even in that case the State governments could\\nhave little to apprehend, because it is only within a certain sphere\\nthat the federal power can, in the nature of things, be advantageously\\nadministered.\\n\\nThe remaining points on which I propose to compare the federal and State\\ngovernments, are the disposition and the faculty they may respectively\\npossess, to resist and frustrate the measures of each other.\\n\\nIt has been already proved that the members of the federal will be more\\ndependent on the members of the State governments, than the latter will\\nbe on the former. It has appeared also, that the prepossessions of the\\npeople, on whom both will depend, will be more on the side of the State\\ngovernments, than of the federal government. So far as the disposition\\nof each towards the other may be influenced by these causes, the State\\ngovernments must clearly have the advantage. But in a distinct and very\\nimportant point of view, the advantage will lie on the same side. The\\nprepossessions, which the members themselves will carry into the federal\\ngovernment, will generally be favorable to the States; whilst it will\\nrarely happen, that the members of the State governments will carry into\\nthe public councils a bias in favor of the general government. A local\\nspirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of Congress,\\nthan a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures of the\\nparticular States. Every one knows that a great proportion of the errors\\ncommitted by the State legislatures proceeds from the disposition of\\nthe members to sacrifice the comprehensive and permanent interest of the\\nState, to the particular and separate views of the counties or districts\\nin which they reside. And if they do not sufficiently enlarge their\\npolicy to embrace the collective welfare of their particular State, how\\ncan it be imagined that they will make the aggregate prosperity of the\\nUnion, and the dignity and respectability of its government, the objects\\nof their affections and consultations? For the same reason that the\\nmembers of the State legislatures will be unlikely to attach themselves\\nsufficiently to national objects, the members of the federal legislature\\nwill be likely to attach themselves too much to local objects. The\\nStates will be to the latter what counties and towns are to the former.\\nMeasures will too often be decided according to their probable effect,\\nnot on the national prosperity and happiness, but on the prejudices,\\ninterests, and pursuits of the governments and people of the individual\\nStates. What is the spirit that has in general characterized the\\nproceedings of Congress? A perusal of their journals, as well as the\\ncandid acknowledgments of such as have had a seat in that assembly,\\nwill inform us, that the members have but too frequently displayed\\nthe character, rather of partisans of their respective States, than of\\nimpartial guardians of a common interest; that where on one occasion\\nimproper sacrifices have been made of local considerations, to the\\naggrandizement of the federal government, the great interests of the\\nnation have suffered on a hundred, from an undue attention to the local\\nprejudices, interests, and views of the particular States. I mean not by\\nthese reflections to insinuate, that the new federal government will not\\nembrace a more enlarged plan of policy than the existing government may\\nhave pursued; much less, that its views will be as confined as those of\\nthe State legislatures; but only that it will partake sufficiently\\nof the spirit of both, to be disinclined to invade the rights of the\\nindividual States, or the prerogatives of their governments. The motives\\non the part of the State governments, to augment their prerogatives\\nby defalcations from the federal government, will be overruled by no\\nreciprocal predispositions in the members.\\n\\nWere it admitted, however, that the Federal government may feel an equal\\ndisposition with the State governments to extend its power beyond the\\ndue limits, the latter would still have the advantage in the means of\\ndefeating such encroachments. If an act of a particular State, though\\nunfriendly to the national government, be generally popular in that\\nState and should not too grossly violate the oaths of the State\\nofficers, it is executed immediately and, of course, by means on the\\nspot and depending on the State alone. The opposition of the federal\\ngovernment, or the interposition of federal officers, would but inflame\\nthe zeal of all parties on the side of the State, and the evil could\\nnot be prevented or repaired, if at all, without the employment of means\\nwhich must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty. On the\\nother hand, should an unwarrantable measure of the federal government be\\nunpopular in particular States, which would seldom fail to be the case,\\nor even a warrantable measure be so, which may sometimes be the case,\\nthe means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand. The disquietude\\nof the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with\\nthe officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the\\nState; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which\\nwould often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State,\\ndifficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very\\nserious impediments; and where the sentiments of several adjoining\\nStates happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the\\nfederal government would hardly be willing to encounter.\\n\\nBut ambitious encroachments of the federal government, on the authority\\nof the State governments, would not excite the opposition of a single\\nState, or of a few States only. They would be signals of general alarm.\\nEvery government would espouse the common cause. A correspondence would\\nbe opened. Plans of resistance would be concerted. One spirit would\\nanimate and conduct the whole. The same combinations, in short, would\\nresult from an apprehension of the federal, as was produced by the\\ndread of a foreign, yoke; and unless the projected innovations should be\\nvoluntarily renounced, the same appeal to a trial of force would be made\\nin the one case as was made in the other. But what degree of madness\\ncould ever drive the federal government to such an extremity. In the\\ncontest with Great Britain, one part of the empire was employed against\\nthe other. The more numerous part invaded the rights of the less\\nnumerous part. The attempt was unjust and unwise; but it was not in\\nspeculation absolutely chimerical. But what would be the contest in the\\ncase we are supposing? Who would be the parties? A few representatives\\nof the people would be opposed to the people themselves; or rather one\\nset of representatives would be contending against thirteen sets of\\nrepresentatives, with the whole body of their common constituents on the\\nside of the latter.\\n\\nThe only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall of the State\\ngovernments is the visionary supposition that the federal government may\\npreviously accumulate a military force for the projects of ambition. The\\nreasonings contained in these papers must have been employed to little\\npurpose indeed, if it could be necessary now to disprove the reality\\nof this danger. That the people and the States should, for a sufficient\\nperiod of time, elect an uninterrupted succession of men ready to betray\\nboth; that the traitors should, throughout this period, uniformly and\\nsystematically pursue some fixed plan for the extension of the military\\nestablishment; that the governments and the people of the States should\\nsilently and patiently behold the gathering storm, and continue to\\nsupply the materials, until it should be prepared to burst on their own\\nheads, must appear to every one more like the incoherent dreams of a\\ndelirious jealousy, or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit\\nzeal, than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism.\\nExtravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a regular\\narmy, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let\\nit be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would\\nnot be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people\\non their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to\\nwhich, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried\\nin any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number\\nof souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This\\nproportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than\\ntwenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia\\namounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands,\\nofficered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common\\nliberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their\\naffections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia\\nthus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of\\nregular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful\\nresistance of this country against the British arms, will be most\\ninclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being\\narmed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other\\nnation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people\\nare attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a\\nbarrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than\\nany which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding\\nthe military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are\\ncarried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are\\nafraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with\\nthis aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were\\nthe people to possess the additional advantages of local governments\\nchosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the\\nnational force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these\\ngovernments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be\\naffirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny\\nin Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which\\nsurround it. Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America\\nwith the suspicion, that they would be less able to defend the rights of\\nwhich they would be in actual possession, than the debased subjects\\nof arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their\\noppressors. Let us rather no longer insult them with the supposition\\nthat they can ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making\\nthe experiment, by a blind and tame submission to the long train of\\ninsidious measures which must precede and produce it.\\n\\nThe argument under the present head may be put into a very concise\\nform, which appears altogether conclusive. Either the mode in which\\nthe federal government is to be constructed will render it sufficiently\\ndependent on the people, or it will not. On the first supposition, it\\nwill be restrained by that dependence from forming schemes obnoxious to\\ntheir constituents. On the other supposition, it will not possess the\\nconfidence of the people, and its schemes of usurpation will be easily\\ndefeated by the State governments, who will be supported by the people.\\n\\nOn summing up the considerations stated in this and the last paper, they\\nseem to amount to the most convincing evidence, that the powers proposed\\nto be lodged in the federal government are as little formidable to those\\nreserved to the individual States, as they are indispensably necessary\\nto accomplish the purposes of the Union; and that all those alarms which\\nhave been sounded, of a meditated and consequential annihilation of\\nthe State governments, must, on the most favorable interpretation, be\\nascribed to the chimerical fears of the authors of them.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 47\\n\\nThe Particular Structure of the New Government and the Distribution of\\nPower Among Its Different Parts.\\n\\nFor the Independent Journal. Wednesday, January 30, 1788.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nHAVING reviewed the general form of the proposed government and\\nthe general mass of power allotted to it, I proceed to examine the\\nparticular structure of this government, and the distribution of this\\nmass of power among its constituent parts.\\n\\nOne of the principal objections inculcated by the more respectable\\nadversaries to the Constitution, is its supposed violation of the\\npolitical maxim, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary\\ndepartments ought to be separate and distinct. In the structure of the\\nfederal government, no regard, it is said, seems to have been paid to\\nthis essential precaution in favor of liberty. The several departments\\nof power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to\\ndestroy all symmetry and beauty of form, and to expose some of the\\nessential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the\\ndisproportionate weight of other parts.\\n\\nNo political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value, or is\\nstamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty, than\\nthat on which the objection is founded. The accumulation of all powers,\\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of\\none, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective,\\nmay justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. Were the\\nfederal Constitution, therefore, really chargeable with the accumulation\\nof power, or with a mixture of powers, having a dangerous tendency to\\nsuch an accumulation, no further arguments would be necessary to inspire\\na universal reprobation of the system. I persuade myself, however,\\nthat it will be made apparent to every one, that the charge cannot\\nbe supported, and that the maxim on which it relies has been totally\\nmisconceived and misapplied. In order to form correct ideas on this\\nimportant subject, it will be proper to investigate the sense in which\\nthe preservation of liberty requires that the three great departments of\\npower should be separate and distinct.\\n\\nThe oracle who is always consulted and cited on this subject is the\\ncelebrated Montesquieu. If he be not the author of this invaluable\\nprecept in the science of politics, he has the merit at least of\\ndisplaying and recommending it most effectually to the attention of\\nmankind. Let us endeavor, in the first place, to ascertain his meaning\\non this point.\\n\\nThe British Constitution was to Montesquieu what Homer has been to the\\ndidactic writers on epic poetry. As the latter have considered the work\\nof the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the principles and\\nrules of the epic art were to be drawn, and by which all similar works\\nwere to be judged, so this great political critic appears to have\\nviewed the Constitution of England as the standard, or to use his own\\nexpression, as the mirror of political liberty; and to have delivered,\\nin the form of elementary truths, the several characteristic principles\\nof that particular system. That we may be sure, then, not to mistake his\\nmeaning in this case, let us recur to the source from which the maxim\\nwas drawn.\\n\\nOn the slightest view of the British Constitution, we must perceive that\\nthe legislative, executive, and judiciary departments are by no means\\ntotally separate and distinct from each other. The executive magistrate\\nforms an integral part of the legislative authority. He alone has the\\nprerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns, which, when\\nmade, have, under certain limitations, the force of legislative acts.\\nAll the members of the judiciary department are appointed by him, can be\\nremoved by him on the address of the two Houses of Parliament, and form,\\nwhen he pleases to consult them, one of his constitutional councils. One\\nbranch of the legislative department forms also a great constitutional\\ncouncil to the executive chief, as, on another hand, it is the sole\\ndepositary of judicial power in cases of impeachment, and is invested\\nwith the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases. The judges,\\nagain, are so far connected with the legislative department as often to\\nattend and participate in its deliberations, though not admitted to a\\nlegislative vote.\\n\\nFrom these facts, by which Montesquieu was guided, it may clearly be\\ninferred that, in saying \"There can be no liberty where the legislative\\nand executive powers are united in the same person, or body of\\nmagistrates,\" or, \"if the power of judging be not separated from\\nthe legislative and executive powers,\" he did not mean that these\\ndepartments ought to have no PARTIAL AGENCY in, or no CONTROL over, the\\nacts of each other. His meaning, as his own words import, and still more\\nconclusively as illustrated by the example in his eye, can amount to\\nno more than this, that where the WHOLE power of one department is\\nexercised by the same hands which possess the WHOLE power of another\\ndepartment, the fundamental principles of a free constitution are\\nsubverted. This would have been the case in the constitution examined\\nby him, if the king, who is the sole executive magistrate, had possessed\\nalso the complete legislative power, or the supreme administration of\\njustice; or if the entire legislative body had possessed the supreme\\njudiciary, or the supreme executive authority. This, however, is not\\namong the vices of that constitution. The magistrate in whom the whole\\nexecutive power resides cannot of himself make a law, though he can put\\na negative on every law; nor administer justice in person, though he has\\nthe appointment of those who do administer it. The judges can exercise\\nno executive prerogative, though they are shoots from the executive\\nstock; nor any legislative function, though they may be advised with\\nby the legislative councils. The entire legislature can perform no\\njudiciary act, though by the joint act of two of its branches the judges\\nmay be removed from their offices, and though one of its branches\\nis possessed of the judicial power in the last resort. The entire\\nlegislature, again, can exercise no executive prerogative, though one of\\nits branches constitutes the supreme executive magistracy, and another,\\non the impeachment of a third, can try and condemn all the subordinate\\nofficers in the executive department.\\n\\nThe reasons on which Montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further\\ndemonstration of his meaning. \"When the legislative and executive\\npowers are united in the same person or body,\" says he, \"there can be no\\nliberty, because apprehensions may arise lest THE SAME monarch or senate\\nshould ENACT tyrannical laws to EXECUTE them in a tyrannical manner.\"\\nAgain: \"Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life\\nand liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for\\nTHE JUDGE would then be THE LEGISLATOR. Were it joined to the executive\\npower, THE JUDGE might behave with all the violence of AN OPPRESSOR.\"\\nSome of these reasons are more fully explained in other passages; but\\nbriefly stated as they are here, they sufficiently establish the meaning\\nwhich we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author.\\n\\nIf we look into the constitutions of the several States, we find that,\\nnotwithstanding the emphatical and, in some instances, the unqualified\\nterms in which this axiom has been laid down, there is not a single\\ninstance in which the several departments of power have been kept\\nabsolutely separate and distinct. New Hampshire, whose constitution was\\nthe last formed, seems to have been fully aware of the impossibility and\\ninexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments,\\nand has qualified the doctrine by declaring \"that the legislative,\\nexecutive, and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate from,\\nand independent of, each other AS THE NATURE OF A FREE GOVERNMENT WILL\\nADMIT; OR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT CHAIN OF CONNECTION THAT BINDS THE\\nWHOLE FABRIC OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ONE INDISSOLUBLE BOND OF UNITY AND\\nAMITY.\" Her constitution accordingly mixes these departments in several\\nrespects. The Senate, which is a branch of the legislative department,\\nis also a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments. The\\nPresident, who is the head of the executive department, is the presiding\\nmember also of the Senate; and, besides an equal vote in all cases,\\nhas a casting vote in case of a tie. The executive head is himself\\neventually elective every year by the legislative department, and\\nhis council is every year chosen by and from the members of the same\\ndepartment. Several of the officers of state are also appointed by the\\nlegislature. And the members of the judiciary department are appointed\\nby the executive department.\\n\\nThe constitution of Massachusetts has observed a sufficient though less\\npointed caution, in expressing this fundamental article of liberty.\\nIt declares \"that the legislative department shall never exercise the\\nexecutive and judicial powers, or either of them; the executive shall\\nnever exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them;\\nthe judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers,\\nor either of them.\" This declaration corresponds precisely with the\\ndoctrine of Montesquieu, as it has been explained, and is not in a\\nsingle point violated by the plan of the convention. It goes no farther\\nthan to prohibit any one of the entire departments from exercising the\\npowers of another department. In the very Constitution to which it is\\nprefixed, a partial mixture of powers has been admitted. The executive\\nmagistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body, and the\\nSenate, which is a part of the legislature, is a court of impeachment\\nfor members both of the executive and judiciary departments. The members\\nof the judiciary department, again, are appointable by the executive\\ndepartment, and removable by the same authority on the address of the\\ntwo legislative branches. Lastly, a number of the officers of government\\nare annually appointed by the legislative department. As the appointment\\nto offices, particularly executive offices, is in its nature an\\nexecutive function, the compilers of the Constitution have, in this last\\npoint at least, violated the rule established by themselves.\\n\\nI pass over the constitutions of Rhode Island and Connecticut, because\\nthey were formed prior to the Revolution, and even before the principle\\nunder examination had become an object of political attention.\\n\\nThe constitution of New York contains no declaration on this subject;\\nbut appears very clearly to have been framed with an eye to the\\ndanger of improperly blending the different departments. It gives,\\nnevertheless, to the executive magistrate, a partial control over the\\nlegislative department; and, what is more, gives a like control to\\nthe judiciary department; and even blends the executive and judiciary\\ndepartments in the exercise of this control. In its council of\\nappointment members of the legislative are associated with the executive\\nauthority, in the appointment of officers, both executive and judiciary.\\nAnd its court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is\\nto consist of one branch of the legislature and the principal members of\\nthe judiciary department.\\n\\nThe constitution of New Jersey has blended the different powers of\\ngovernment more than any of the preceding. The governor, who is the\\nexecutive magistrate, is appointed by the legislature; is chancellor and\\nordinary, or surrogate of the State; is a member of the Supreme Court of\\nAppeals, and president, with a casting vote, of one of the legislative\\nbranches. The same legislative branch acts again as executive council of\\nthe governor, and with him constitutes the Court of Appeals. The members\\nof the judiciary department are appointed by the legislative department\\nand removable by one branch of it, on the impeachment of the other.\\n\\nAccording to the constitution of Pennsylvania, the president, who is the\\nhead of the executive department, is annually elected by a vote in\\nwhich the legislative department predominates. In conjunction with an\\nexecutive council, he appoints the members of the judiciary department,\\nand forms a court of impeachment for trial of all officers, judiciary as\\nwell as executive. The judges of the Supreme Court and justices of the\\npeace seem also to be removable by the legislature; and the executive\\npower of pardoning in certain cases, to be referred to the same\\ndepartment. The members of the executive council are made EX-OFFICIO\\njustices of peace throughout the State.\\n\\nIn Delaware, the chief executive magistrate is annually elected by the\\nlegislative department. The speakers of the two legislative branches are\\nvice-presidents in the executive department. The executive chief,\\nwith six others, appointed, three by each of the legislative branches\\nconstitutes the Supreme Court of Appeals; he is joined with the\\nlegislative department in the appointment of the other judges.\\nThroughout the States, it appears that the members of the legislature\\nmay at the same time be justices of the peace; in this State, the\\nmembers of one branch of it are EX-OFFICIO justices of the peace; as are\\nalso the members of the executive council. The principal officers of the\\nexecutive department are appointed by the legislative; and one branch of\\nthe latter forms a court of impeachments. All officers may be removed on\\naddress of the legislature.\\n\\nMaryland has adopted the maxim in the most unqualified terms; declaring\\nthat the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of government ought\\nto be forever separate and distinct from each other. Her constitution,\\nnotwithstanding, makes the executive magistrate appointable by the\\nlegislative department; and the members of the judiciary by the\\nexecutive department.\\n\\nThe language of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her\\nconstitution declares, \"that the legislative, executive, and judiciary\\ndepartments shall be separate and distinct; so that neither exercise the\\npowers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise\\nthe powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that\\nthe justices of county courts shall be eligible to either House of\\nAssembly.\" Yet we find not only this express exception, with respect to\\nthe members of the inferior courts, but that the chief magistrate, with\\nhis executive council, are appointable by the legislature; that two\\nmembers of the latter are triennially displaced at the pleasure of the\\nlegislature; and that all the principal offices, both executive and\\njudiciary, are filled by the same department. The executive prerogative\\nof pardon, also, is in one case vested in the legislative department.\\n\\nThe constitution of North Carolina, which declares \"that the\\nlegislative, executive, and supreme judicial powers of government ought\\nto be forever separate and distinct from each other,\" refers, at the\\nsame time, to the legislative department, the appointment not only of\\nthe executive chief, but all the principal officers within both that and\\nthe judiciary department.\\n\\nIn South Carolina, the constitution makes the executive magistracy\\neligible by the legislative department. It gives to the latter, also,\\nthe appointment of the members of the judiciary department, including\\neven justices of the peace and sheriffs; and the appointment of officers\\nin the executive department, down to captains in the army and navy of\\nthe State.\\n\\nIn the constitution of Georgia, where it is declared \"that the\\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and\\ndistinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to\\nthe other,\" we find that the executive department is to be filled by\\nappointments of the legislature; and the executive prerogative of pardon\\nto be finally exercised by the same authority. Even justices of the\\npeace are to be appointed by the legislature.\\n\\nIn citing these cases, in which the legislative, executive, and\\njudiciary departments have not been kept totally separate and\\ndistinct, I wish not to be regarded as an advocate for the particular\\norganizations of the several State governments. I am fully aware that\\namong the many excellent principles which they exemplify, they carry\\nstrong marks of the haste, and still stronger of the inexperience, under\\nwhich they were framed. It is but too obvious that in some instances the\\nfundamental principle under consideration has been violated by too great\\na mixture, and even an actual consolidation, of the different powers;\\nand that in no instance has a competent provision been made for\\nmaintaining in practice the separation delineated on paper. What I\\nhave wished to evince is, that the charge brought against the proposed\\nConstitution, of violating the sacred maxim of free government, is\\nwarranted neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its\\nauthor, nor by the sense in which it has hitherto been understood in\\nAmerica. This interesting subject will be resumed in the ensuing paper.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 48\\n\\nThese Departments Should Not Be So Far Separated as to Have No\\nConstitutional Control Over Each Other.\\n\\nFrom the New York Packet. Friday, February 1, 1788.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nIT WAS shown in the last paper that the political apothegm there\\nexamined does not require that the legislative, executive, and judiciary\\ndepartments should be wholly unconnected with each other. I shall\\nundertake, in the next place, to show that unless these departments be\\nso far connected and blended as to give to each a constitutional control\\nover the others, the degree of separation which the maxim requires,\\nas essential to a free government, can never in practice be duly\\nmaintained.\\n\\nIt is agreed on all sides, that the powers properly belonging to one of\\nthe departments ought not to be directly and completely administered\\nby either of the other departments. It is equally evident, that none of\\nthem ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence\\nover the others, in the administration of their respective powers. It\\nwill not be denied, that power is of an encroaching nature, and that it\\nought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to\\nit. After discriminating, therefore, in theory, the several classes\\nof power, as they may in their nature be legislative, executive, or\\njudiciary, the next and most difficult task is to provide some practical\\nsecurity for each, against the invasion of the others. What this\\nsecurity ought to be, is the great problem to be solved.\\n\\nWill it be sufficient to mark, with precision, the boundaries of these\\ndepartments, in the constitution of the government, and to trust to\\nthese parchment barriers against the encroaching spirit of power? This\\nis the security which appears to have been principally relied on by the\\ncompilers of most of the American constitutions. But experience assures\\nus, that the efficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated; and\\nthat some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the\\nmore feeble, against the more powerful, members of the government.\\nThe legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its\\nactivity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.\\n\\nThe founders of our republics have so much merit for the wisdom which\\nthey have displayed, that no task can be less pleasing than that of\\npointing out the errors into which they have fallen. A respect for\\ntruth, however, obliges us to remark, that they seem never for a moment\\nto have turned their eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown\\nand all-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate, supported and\\nfortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative authority. They\\nseem never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations,\\nwhich, by assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same\\ntyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations.\\n\\nIn a government where numerous and extensive prerogatives are placed\\nin the hands of an hereditary monarch, the executive department is\\nvery justly regarded as the source of danger, and watched with all the\\njealousy which a zeal for liberty ought to inspire. In a democracy,\\nwhere a multitude of people exercise in person the legislative\\nfunctions, and are continually exposed, by their incapacity for regular\\ndeliberation and concerted measures, to the ambitious intrigues of\\ntheir executive magistrates, tyranny may well be apprehended, on\\nsome favorable emergency, to start up in the same quarter. But in a\\nrepresentative republic, where the executive magistracy is carefully\\nlimited; both in the extent and the duration of its power; and where the\\nlegislative power is exercised by an assembly, which is inspired, by a\\nsupposed influence over the people, with an intrepid confidence in its\\nown strength; which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions\\nwhich actuate a multitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of\\npursuing the objects of its passions, by means which reason prescribes;\\nit is against the enterprising ambition of this department that the\\npeople ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their\\nprecautions.\\n\\nThe legislative department derives a superiority in our governments\\nfrom other circumstances. Its constitutional powers being at once more\\nextensive, and less susceptible of precise limits, it can, with the\\ngreater facility, mask, under complicated and indirect measures, the\\nencroachments which it makes on the co-ordinate departments. It is not\\nunfrequently a question of real nicety in legislative bodies, whether\\nthe operation of a particular measure will, or will not, extend beyond\\nthe legislative sphere. On the other side, the executive power being\\nrestrained within a narrower compass, and being more simple in its\\nnature, and the judiciary being described by landmarks still less\\nuncertain, projects of usurpation by either of these departments would\\nimmediately betray and defeat themselves. Nor is this all: as the\\nlegislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people,\\nand has in some constitutions full discretion, and in all a prevailing\\ninfluence, over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other\\ndepartments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives\\nstill greater facility to encroachments of the former.\\n\\nI have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what I advance on\\nthis subject. Were it necessary to verify this experience by particular\\nproofs, they might be multiplied without end. I might find a witness\\nin every citizen who has shared in, or been attentive to, the course of\\npublic administrations. I might collect vouchers in abundance from the\\nrecords and archives of every State in the Union. But as a more concise,\\nand at the same time equally satisfactory, evidence, I will refer to the\\nexample of two States, attested by two unexceptionable authorities.\\n\\nThe first example is that of Virginia, a State which, as we have\\nseen, has expressly declared in its constitution, that the three great\\ndepartments ought not to be intermixed. The authority in support of it\\nis Mr. Jefferson, who, besides his other advantages for remarking the\\noperation of the government, was himself the chief magistrate of it. In\\norder to convey fully the ideas with which his experience had impressed\\nhim on this subject, it will be necessary to quote a passage of some\\nlength from his very interesting Notes on the State of Virginia, p. 195.\\n\"All the powers of government, legislative, executive, and judiciary,\\nresult to the legislative body. The concentrating these in the same\\nhands, is precisely the definition of despotic government. It will be\\nno alleviation, that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of\\nhands, and not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots\\nwould surely be as oppressive as one. Let those who doubt it, turn their\\neyes on the republic of Venice. As little will it avail us, that they\\nare chosen by ourselves. An ELECTIVE DESPOTISM was not the government we\\nfought for; but one which should not only be founded on free principles,\\nbut in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced\\namong several bodies of magistracy, as that no one could transcend their\\nlegal limits, without being effectually checked and restrained by the\\nothers. For this reason, that convention which passed the ordinance of\\ngovernment, laid its foundation on this basis, that the legislative,\\nexecutive, and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct,\\nso that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at\\nthe same time. BUT NO BARRIER WAS PROVIDED BETWEEN THESE SEVERAL POWERS.\\nThe judiciary and the executive members were left dependent on the\\nlegislative for their subsistence in office, and some of them for their\\ncontinuance in it. If, therefore, the legislature assumes executive and\\njudiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made; nor, if made, can\\nbe effectual; because in that case they may put their proceedings into\\nthe form of acts of Assembly, which will render them obligatory on the\\nother branches. They have accordingly, IN MANY instances, DECIDED RIGHTS\\nwhich should have been left to JUDICIARY CONTROVERSY, and THE DIRECTION\\nOF THE EXECUTIVE, DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THEIR SESSION, IS BECOMING\\nHABITUAL AND FAMILIAR.\"\\n\\nThe other State which I shall take for an example is Pennsylvania; and\\nthe other authority, the Council of Censors, which assembled in the\\nyears 1783 and 1784. A part of the duty of this body, as marked out\\nby the constitution, was \"to inquire whether the constitution had been\\npreserved inviolate in every part; and whether the legislative and\\nexecutive branches of government had performed their duty as guardians\\nof the people, or assumed to themselves, or exercised, other or greater\\npowers than they are entitled to by the constitution.\" In the execution\\nof this trust, the council were necessarily led to a comparison of\\nboth the legislative and executive proceedings, with the constitutional\\npowers of these departments; and from the facts enumerated, and to the\\ntruth of most of which both sides in the council subscribed, it appears\\nthat the constitution had been flagrantly violated by the legislature in\\na variety of important instances.\\n\\nA great number of laws had been passed, violating, without any apparent\\nnecessity, the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature shall be\\npreviously printed for the consideration of the people; although this\\nis one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the constitution against\\nimproper acts of legislature.\\n\\nThe constitutional trial by jury had been violated, and powers assumed\\nwhich had not been delegated by the constitution.\\n\\nExecutive powers had been usurped.\\n\\nThe salaries of the judges, which the constitution expressly requires\\nto be fixed, had been occasionally varied; and cases belonging to the\\njudiciary department frequently drawn within legislative cognizance and\\ndetermination.\\n\\nThose who wish to see the several particulars falling under each of\\nthese heads, may consult the journals of the council, which are in\\nprint. Some of them, it will be found, may be imputable to peculiar\\ncircumstances connected with the war; but the greater part of them\\nmay be considered as the spontaneous shoots of an ill-constituted\\ngovernment.\\n\\nIt appears, also, that the executive department had not been innocent\\nof frequent breaches of the constitution. There are three observations,\\nhowever, which ought to be made on this head: FIRST, a great proportion\\nof the instances were either immediately produced by the necessities of\\nthe war, or recommended by Congress or the commander-in-chief; SECOND,\\nin most of the other instances, they conformed either to the declared or\\nthe known sentiments of the legislative department; THIRD, the executive\\ndepartment of Pennsylvania is distinguished from that of the other\\nStates by the number of members composing it. In this respect, it has as\\nmuch affinity to a legislative assembly as to an executive council. And\\nbeing at once exempt from the restraint of an individual responsibility\\nfor the acts of the body, and deriving confidence from mutual example\\nand joint influence, unauthorized measures would, of course, be more\\nfreely hazarded, than where the executive department is administered by\\na single hand, or by a few hands.\\n\\nThe conclusion which I am warranted in drawing from these observations\\nis, that a mere demarcation on parchment of the constitutional limits\\nof the several departments, is not a sufficient guard against those\\nencroachments which lead to a tyrannical concentration of all the powers\\nof government in the same hands.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

              "' 10\\n\\nThe Same Subject Continued (The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic\\nFaction and Insurrection)\\n\\nFrom the Daily Advertiser. Thursday, November 22, 1787.\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nAMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed Union, none\\ndeserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and\\ncontrol the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never\\nfinds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he\\ncontemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail,\\ntherefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the\\nprinciples to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it.\\nThe instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public\\ncouncils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular\\ngovernments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the\\nfavorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty\\nderive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made\\nby the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient\\nand modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an\\nunwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually\\nobviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints\\nare everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens,\\nequally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and\\npersonal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public\\ngood is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures\\nare too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the\\nrights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested\\nand overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these\\ncomplaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not\\npermit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found,\\nindeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses\\nunder which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation\\nof our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other\\ncauses will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes;\\nand, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public\\nengagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one\\nend of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly,\\neffects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit\\nhas tainted our public administrations.\\n\\nBy a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a\\nmajority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some\\ncommon impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of\\nother citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the\\ncommunity.\\n\\nThere are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by\\nremoving its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.\\n\\nThere are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the\\none, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the\\nother, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions,\\nand the same interests.\\n\\nIt could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was\\nworse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an\\naliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less\\nfolly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because\\nit nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of\\nair, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its\\ndestructive agency.\\n\\nThe second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise.\\nAs long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty\\nto exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the\\nconnection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions\\nand his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the\\nformer will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The\\ndiversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property\\noriginate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of\\ninterests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of\\ngovernment. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of\\nacquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of\\nproperty immediately results; and from the influence of these on the\\nsentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of\\nthe society into different interests and parties.\\n\\nThe latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and\\nwe see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity,\\naccording to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for\\ndifferent opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many\\nother points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to\\ndifferent leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or\\nto persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting\\nto the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties,\\ninflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more\\ndisposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their\\ncommon good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual\\nanimosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the\\nmost frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle\\ntheir unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But\\nthe most common and durable source of factions has been the various\\nand unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are\\nwithout property have ever formed distinct interests in society.\\nThose who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a\\nlike discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a\\nmercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,\\ngrow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into\\ndifferent classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The\\nregulation of these various and interfering interests forms the\\nprincipal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party\\nand faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.\\n\\nNo man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest\\nwould certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his\\nintegrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit\\nto be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the\\nmost important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations,\\nnot indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the\\nrights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes\\nof legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they\\ndetermine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question\\nto which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the\\nother. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties\\nare, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party,\\nor, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to\\nprevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree,\\nby restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be\\ndifferently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and\\nprobably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good.\\nThe apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is\\nan act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is,\\nperhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation\\nare given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice.\\nEvery shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a\\nshilling saved to their own pockets.\\n\\nIt is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust\\nthese clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public\\ngood. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many\\ncases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view\\nindirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the\\nimmediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights\\nof another or the good of the whole.\\n\\nThe inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction\\ncannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of\\ncontrolling its EFFECTS.\\n\\nIf a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the\\nrepublican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister\\nviews by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse\\nthe society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence\\nunder the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a\\nfaction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it\\nto sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good\\nand the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private\\nrights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to\\npreserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the\\ngreat object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is\\nthe great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued\\nfrom the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be\\nrecommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.\\n\\nBy what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only.\\nEither the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at\\nthe same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent\\npassion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local\\nsituation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of\\noppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide,\\nwe well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on\\nas an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice\\nand violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to\\nthe number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy\\nbecomes needful.\\n\\nFrom this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy,\\nby which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who\\nassemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure\\nfor the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in\\nalmost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication\\nand concert result from the form of government itself; and there is\\nnothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an\\nobnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever\\nbeen spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found\\nincompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have\\nin general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in\\ntheir deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species\\nof government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to\\na perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same\\ntime, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their\\nopinions, and their passions.\\n\\nA republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of\\nrepresentation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises\\nthe cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it\\nvaries from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of\\nthe cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.\\n\\nThe two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic\\nare: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small\\nnumber of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of\\ncitizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be\\nextended.\\n\\nThe effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and\\nenlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen\\nbody of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of\\ntheir country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least\\nlikely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under\\nsuch a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced\\nby the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the\\npublic good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for\\nthe purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of\\nfactious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by\\nintrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages,\\nand then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is,\\nwhether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election\\nof proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in\\nfavor of the latter by two obvious considerations:\\n\\nIn the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the\\nrepublic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number,\\nin order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large\\nit may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to\\nguard against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of\\nrepresentatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of\\nthe two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small\\nrepublic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not\\nless in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a\\ngreater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.\\n\\nIn the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater\\nnumber of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will\\nbe more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the\\nvicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages\\nof the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who\\npossess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established\\ncharacters.\\n\\nIt must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a\\nmean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie.\\nBy enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the\\nrepresentatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances\\nand lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly\\nattached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and\\nnational objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in\\nthis respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the\\nnational, the local and particular to the State legislatures.\\n\\nThe other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens\\nand extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of\\nrepublican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance\\nprincipally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded\\nin the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer\\nprobably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the\\nfewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will\\na majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of\\nindividuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within\\nwhich they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute\\ntheir plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater\\nvariety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a\\nmajority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights\\nof other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more\\ndifficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act\\nin unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked\\nthat, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes,\\ncommunication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number\\nwhose concurrence is necessary.\\n\\nHence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has\\nover a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by\\na large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the\\nStates composing it. Does the advantage consist in the substitution of\\nrepresentatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render\\nthem superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not\\nbe denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely\\nto possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater\\nsecurity afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of\\nany one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal\\ndegree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the\\nUnion, increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater\\nobstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes\\nof an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the\\nUnion gives it the most palpable advantage.\\n\\nThe influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their\\nparticular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration\\nthrough the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a\\npolitical faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects\\ndispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils\\nagainst any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an\\nabolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other\\nimproper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body\\nof the Union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as\\nsuch a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district,\\nthan an entire State.\\n\\nIn the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold\\na republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican\\ngovernment. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel\\nin being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and\\nsupporting the character of Federalists.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
